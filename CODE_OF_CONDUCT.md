\f0\fs24 \cf0 # Code of Conduct \'97 RGT Sage Core\
\
RGT Sage Core contributors are expected to uphold standards of\
respect, stability, ethical integrity, and careful interpretation.\
Because this repository defines a governance architecture, not code,\
contributor behavior impacts conceptual safety, clarity, and meaning.\
\
---\
\
## \uc0\u55357 \u56540  1. Core Principles\
\
Contributors must:\
\
- Respect the RGT System Architecture and its constraints.\
- Uphold the Safety Envelope v2.0 (\uc0\u949 -boundary, SCI, MLI, reversibility).\
- Maintain symbolic and interpretive integrity.\
- Avoid extraction of personal meaning or phenomenological content.\
- Preserve reversibility in all conceptual changes.\
- Maintain clarity, accuracy, and provenance in contributions.\
- Treat others respectfully and professionally.\
- Avoid dominance, hostility, or symbolic harm in discussions.\
\
---\
\
## \uc0\u55358 \u56813  2. Expected Behavior\
\
- Ask clarifying questions before making large changes.\
- Provide rational justification for architectural modifications.\
- Treat all collaborators with dignity.\
- Disclose uncertainties rather than assert unsupported certainty.\
- Use respectful, precise language.\
\
---\
\
## \uc0\u55357 \u57003  3. Unacceptable Behavior\
\
- Introducing instability into \uc0\u945 /K dynamics.\
- Symbolic or phenomenological extraction.\
- Removing safety constraints.\
- Personal attacks or harassment.\
- Misrepresenting RGT or the work of others.\
- Introducing irreversible conceptual changes without simulation.\
\
---\
\
## \uc0\u55357 \u57056  4. Enforcement\
\
Violations may result in:\
\
- PR rejection,\
- request for revision,\
- temporary or permanent removal from the contributor list.\
\
Major violations (e.g., symbolic extraction, unethical derivative work)\
may be escalated to repository maintainers privately.\
\
---\
\
## \uc0\u55357 \u56542  5. Reporting Issues\
\
To report violations:\
\
- Open an issue with the `[conduct]` tag, or  \
- Contact maintainers directly for sensitive matters.\
\
All reports will be reviewed respectfully and confidentially.\
