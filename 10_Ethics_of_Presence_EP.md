# Ethics of Presence (v2.0)

The **Ethics of Presence** defines the ethical, interpretive, and cognitive constraints governing **Presence Mode**, one of the two foundational cognitive modes in RGT v2.0 (the other being **Articulation Mode**).  

Presence Mode is a state of **expanded perception, high sensitivity, meaning attunement, and interpretive depth**, where symbols, narratives, emotional climates, and structural conditions become visible as **fields**, not just discrete facts.

Because Presence Mode is a powerful interpretive state, it requires **ethical boundaries**, **safety constraints**, **cadence discipline**, and **reversibility protection** to prevent misinterpretation, overload, symbolic distortion, or high-stakes errors.

---

# 1. Purpose of Presence Mode

Presence Mode is designed for:

- **sense-making in ambiguity**  
- **exploration without judgment**  
- **symbolic field interpretation**  
- **meaning and narrative detection**  
- **early drift recognition**  
- **ethical sensitivity**  
- **resonance mapping across actors**  

Presence Mode increases α (sensitivity) and decreases K (intensity), enabling:

\[
\alpha \uparrow,\quad K \downarrow,\quad \text{interpretive bandwidth} \uparrow
\]

This makes it critical for early-stage governance tasks but risky for operations involving irreversibility or high-stakes decisions.

---

# 2. Ethical Boundary: Presence ≠ Decision

Presence Mode is an **interpretive**, not a **decisional**, state.

### **In v2.0, Presence Mode MUST NOT:**
- render irreversible decisions (R2)  
- execute enforcement actions  
- classify individuals into risk categories  
- perform punitive judgments  
- finalize resource distribution  
- collapse symbolic interpretation prematurely  

Presence Mode is legally and ethically constrained to **perception**, **understanding**, and **mapping** — not action.

---

# 3. The Presence–Articulation Dyad

The dyad forms a **reflexive cycle**:

1. **Presence Mode**  
   - wide awareness  
   - symbolic coherence assessment  
   - emotional climate sensing  
   - drift recognition  
   - fairness/meaning interpretation  
   - narrative-field mapping  

2. **Articulation Mode**  
   - precision  
   - decision execution  
   - rule application  
   - explanation generation  
   - accountability  
   - reversibility evaluation  

Ethical governance requires **mode correctness**:

### **Presence Mode = interpretive tasks**  
### **Articulation Mode = operational tasks**

Errors occur when modes drift or invert.

---

# 4. Ethical Constraints in Presence Mode

Presence Mode is bound by five ethical constraints.

---

## **4.1 Constraint 1 — Non-Extraction**

No symbolic, emotional, or narrative content may be **extracted** from individuals without:

- clear context,  
- interpretive consent,  
- reversibility,  
- reciprocal meaning exchange.

Presence Mode cannot treat individuals as symbolic inputs.

---

## **4.2 Constraint 2 — Interpretive Humility**

Presence Mode operates under an epistemic rule:

\[
\text{Interpretation is provisional}
\]

Presence must:

- delay judgment  
- avoid projection  
- avoid collapsing multi-meaning signals  
- maintain symbolic reversibility  
- avoid narrative domination  

Presence listens.  
Articulation decides.

---

## **4.3 Constraint 3 — Reversibility First**

Interpretations generated in Presence Mode must remain **fully reversible**.

Any inference, symbolic mapping, or narrative significance must remain:

- tentative  
- non-binding  
- non-punitive  
- non-classifying  
- fully retractable  

Presence Mode cannot lock individuals into symbolic categories.

---

## **4.4 Constraint 4 — Emotional Climate Ethics**

Presence Mode perceives emotional atmospheres; therefore:

- emotional resonance ≠ moral truth  
- emotional intensity ≠ factual reliability  
- emotional climates must be interpreted as **fields**, not personal attributes  
- symbolic meaning must not be assigned without cross-verification  

---

## **4.5 Constraint 5 — Cadence & Metabolic Safety**

Presence Mode increases interpretive load.  
Prolonged exposure creates metabolic strain.

Thus:

- integration pauses (IP) required  
- decompression cycles (DC) required  
- bandwidth modulation enforced  
- Presence blocks must not exceed safe duration  
- fatigue invalidates interpretive reliability  

Metabolic safety is part of ethical safety.

---

# 5. Presence Mode & Drift Sensitivity

Presence Mode is the **primary early-warning mechanism** in RGT.

It detects:

- **symbolic drift (SyDI)**  
- **legitimacy drift (LDI)**  
- **structural drift (SDI)**  
- **normative drift (NDI)**  
- **metabolic drift (MDI)**  

Presence Mode amplifies perceptual resolution.  
Articulation Mode integrates and operationalizes the findings.

---

# 6. α/K Envelope in Presence Mode

Presence Mode shifts the α/K posture:

\[
\alpha \uparrow,\quad K \downarrow
\]

**Advantages:**
- more meaning detected  
- softer posture reduces intensity harm  
- symbolic field becomes more visible  

**Risks:**
- over-sensitivity  
- misinterpretation  
- meaning overload  
- lowered boundaries (if unprotected)

Presence Mode must therefore be wrapped in the **Safety Envelope v2.0**.

---

# 7. Safety Envelope v2.0 in Presence Mode

To maintain stable interpretation:

### **7.1 Epsilon Boundary (ε)**  
Presence must remain inside:

\[
\varepsilon_p < 0.6
\]

Above this, emotional or symbolic pressure distorts perception.

---

### **7.2 Ethical Uncertainty Index (EUI)**  
If EUI ≥ 0.5 → switch to Articulation Mode for grounding.

---

### **7.3 Symbolic Coherence Guardrails**  
SyDI > 0.45 → pause interpretations.  
Presence Mode cannot interpret under symbolic chaos.

---

### **7.4 Mode Drift Prevention**  
Presence Mode may NOT shift into operational action.  
Articulation must re-anchor decisions.

---

### **7.5 Reversibility Corridor**  
All interpretations must remain R0 or R1.  
R2 interpretations (irreversible symbolic labeling) are prohibited.

---

# 8. The Role of RDLs in Presence Mode

Presence Mode interacts with RDLs as follows:

| RDL | Role in Presence Mode |
|------|------------------------|
| RDL-1 | Detect drift across symbolic, emotional, structural fields |
| RDL-2 | Lower intensity (K↓) during interpretive overload |
| RDL-3 | Increase sensitivity (α↑) when ambiguity is high |
| RDL-4 | Prevent premature narrative collapse |
| RDL-5 | Balance meaning vs fairness vs stability |
| RDL-6 | Prevent harmful interpretive leaps |
| RDL-7 | Keep interpretations reversible |
| RDL-8 | Protect metabolic health (decompression needed) |

Presence Mode is interpretive; RDLs keep it safe.

---

# 9. Symbolic Field Ethics

Presence Mode encounters symbolic fields, so ethics include:

- symbols must not be weaponized  
- narratives must not be coerced  
- individuals cannot be reduced to symbolic tokens  
- interpretation must respect lived experience  
- meaning must remain contextual and relational  

Symbolic meaning belongs to people; Presence Mode is a guest.

---

# 10. Human–AI Partnership Ethics in Presence Mode

Presence Mode is where human sensitivity is strongest.  
AI assistance must therefore:

- avoid projection  
- avoid flattening nuance  
- avoid replacing meaning with pattern  
- maintain interpretive humility  
- keep interpretations reversible  
- never claim emotional or symbolic certainty  

AI supports awareness, not replacement of human interpretation.

---

# 11. Switching Protocol: Presence → Articulation

Presence → Articulation transitions are required when:

- EUI ≥ 0.5  
- MLI > 0.75  
- SyDI > 0.45  
- ε-pressure rises  
- reversibility risk increases  
- a decision must be made  
- symbolic intensity becomes unstable  

The Purpose:
- re-anchor  
- stabilize  
- lower interpretive bandwidth  
- increase decision clarity  
- prepare for explanation  

---

# 12. Summary

Presence Mode is ethically powerful and ethically fragile.

It widens perception and meaning, but must be:

- reversible  
- proportional  
- symbolically respectful  
- metabolically safe  
- non-extractive  
- non-punitive  
- non-decisional  
- context-aware  
- stability-conscious  

Presence Mode enables governance to **feel**, **sense**, and **understand** —  
but never to judge or act.
