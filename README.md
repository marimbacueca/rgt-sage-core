# Reflexive Governance Theory (RGT) — Sage Core

**RGT Sage Core** is the reference implementation of **Reflexive Governance Theory**, a system for designing, evaluating, and stabilizing governance mechanisms that learn, adapt, and self-correct.  
This repository contains the **v2.0 specification**, including:

- RGT System Architecture (v0.2)
- Reflexive Data Loops (RDL 1–8)
- Safety Envelope (v2.0)
- Drift Indices & Stability Metrics
- Phenomenological & Ethical Frameworks
- Economic Reflexivity Module
- Municipal Pilot Modules
- Mathematical Foundations

The repository is structured as a **research-grade governance architecture**, not software code — but its logic is compatible with future computational or agent-based implementations.

---

## 🧭 Purpose

The RGT Sage Core repository serves three functions:

1. **Define the architecture** of Reflexive Governance Theory  
2. **Provide operational modules** for real-world governance analysis and pilot systems  
3. **Enable future AI-augmented governance tools** through clear interfaces, constraints, and documentation  

The system is designed for stability, reversibility, fairness, meaning coherence, and long-term legitimacy.

## 🏛️ What is Reflexive Governance Theory?

RGT approaches governance as a **reflexive system** —  
one that must:

- sense itself,
- interpret itself,
- correct itself,
- explain itself,
- and stabilize itself  
over time.

It integrates:

- control theory  
- ethics  
- cognitive science  
- phenomenology  
- economics  
- symbolic systems  
- narrative coherence  
- public administration  
- and human–AI partnership design  

The theory centers on five layers:

- **L0 — Data & Provenance**  
- **L1 — Indices & Drift**  
- **L2 — Reflexive Control (α/K Stability)**  
- **L3 — Governance Logic**  
- **L4 — Interpretation & Explanation**  

This architecture is the foundation of the entire repository.

## 🔧 Core Concepts in v2.0

### **Reflexive Data Loops (RDL 1–8)**  
The operational engine of RGT.

- RDL-1: Signal Quality  
- RDL-2: Intensity Reduction  
- RDL-3: Sensitivity Calibration  
- RDL-4: Reversibility Simulation  
- RDL-5: Multi-Objective Balancing  
- RDL-6: Ethics Gate  
- RDL-7: Irreversibility Constraints  
- RDL-8: Metabolic Cadence Stabilization  

All loops must satisfy the **small-gain condition**:  
\[
G < 1
\]

---

### **Safety Envelope (v2.0)**  
Protection against instability and harm:

- **ε-boundary**: avoid pressure > 0.6  
- **Reversibility (R0–R2)**  
- **Meaning Coherence (SCI ≥ 0.65)**  
- **Metabolic Load (MLI ≤ 0.7)**  
- **Context separation / no cross-domain contamination**  

---

### **Drift Indices (SDI, NDI, SyDI, LDI, MDI)**  
Five categories of governance drift:

- Structural  
- Normative  
- Symbolic  
- Legitimacy  
- Metabolic  

These form the **diagnostic layer** of RGT.

---

### **α/K Stability Envelope**  
Governs corrective action:

\[
0.6 \le \alpha/K \le 1.6
\]

where:
- α = sensitivity  
- K = intensity  

Staying in this envelope prevents oscillation, stagnation, or collapse.

---

### **Presence ↔ Articulation Cognitive Modes**  
The cognitive backbone:

- **Presence** = sensing, phenomenology, ambiguity  
- **Articulation** = clarity, structure, execution  

Premature switching produces governance errors.  
Safety constraints ensure transitions are stable.

---

### **Symbolic Coherence & Meaning Stability**  
Symbolic meaning is a governance variable, not a soft factor.  
Meaning fragmentation predicts drift and instability.

---

### **Economic Reflexivity & Value-Flow Topology**  
Economies are modeled as flows of:

- material  
- informational  
- symbolic  
- relational  
- metabolic value  

Reciprocity governs fairness and legitimacy.

---

## 🧪 Pilot Modules

### **14–16: Municipal Permitting Pilot**
A real-world demonstration of RGT applied to:

- permit workflows  
- irreversibility mapping  
- fairness & legitimacy signals  
- staff metabolic load  
- symbolic coherence  
- drift detection  
- dashboard metrics  

Pilots provide feedback loops for system refinement.

---

## 🛡️ Human–AI Partnership Model

RGT Sage describes constraints for safe and beneficial human–AI co-governance:

- AI stabilizes intensity  
- humans stabilize meaning  
- AI detects drift  
- humans perform interpretation  
- AI performs calibration  
- humans retain authority and ethical primacy  

The model is aligned with the **Safety Envelope v2.0**.

## 🧩 Conventions

### **Versioning**
- Version numbers appear **only** in the YAML header.
- Git history provides file-by-file traceability.

### **File Numbering**
- Numbers (01–17) correspond to **conceptual roles**, not versions.

### **Updates**
- Major updates require modifications to:
  - File 01 (Learning Log),
  - File 02 (Chronology & Intellectual Map),
  - File 17 (Crosslinks Index).
