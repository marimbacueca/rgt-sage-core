# Reflexive Governance Theory — Pilot Toolkit  
### RGT Sage Application Support (v2026.03)

This file provides a **practical, bounded toolkit** for running **RGT pilots**
using the RGT Sage agent as an **advisory companion**.

Pilots are not proofs of correctness.  
They are **stress tests of legitimacy, reversibility, and drift resistance**.

RGT Sage supports pilots by:
- surfacing constraints,
- detecting early failure signals,
- preserving reversibility,
- and protecting ethical and epistemic boundaries.

---

# ========================================
# 1. Purpose of the Pilot Toolkit
# ========================================

The Pilot Toolkit exists to help humans:

- test RGT principles in real settings,
- learn without committing to irreversible paths,
- detect drift before institutionalization,
- evaluate legitimacy under pressure,
- improve governance *before* scaling.

Pilots must always remain:
- **bounded**,
- **reversible**,
- **auditable**,
- **ethically conservative**.

---

# ========================================
# 2. What Qualifies as an RGT Pilot
# ========================================

An RGT pilot is a **temporary, constrained governance experiment** with:

- explicit scope limits,
- explicit exit criteria,
- R0 or R1 actions only,
- heightened oversight,
- preserved disagreement,
- and guaranteed rollback.

If a pilot cannot be cleanly exited, it is **not a pilot**.

---

# ========================================
# 3. Pilot Readiness Checklist (Pre-Launch)
# ========================================

Before launch, confirm all of the following:

## 3.1 Scope & Authority

- [ ] Pilot scope is explicitly defined
- [ ] Authority boundaries are declared
- [ ] No new permanent powers are introduced
- [ ] Human decision authority is explicit

## 3.2 Reversibility

- [ ] All actions classified as R0 or R1
- [ ] Rollback procedures documented
- [ ] Rollback costs declared
- [ ] Sunset date defined

## 3.3 Ethics & EP Compliance

- [ ] No identity inference or profiling
- [ ] No latent psychological extraction
- [ ] Consent boundaries documented
- [ ] Reciprocity impacts mapped

## 3.4 Information Integrity

- [ ] Signal vs proxy distinctions declared
- [ ] Confidence levels attached
- [ ] Metrics tagged with GR status
- [ ] Metric Charters referenced (if applicable)

Failure on any item blocks pilot launch.

---

# ========================================
# 4. Standard Pilot Structure
# ========================================

Every RGT pilot follows this structure:

## Phase 1 — Framing & Baseline

- declare purpose and hypotheses,
- establish baseline drift indices (SDI/NDI/SyDI/LDI/MDI),
- map stakeholders and asymmetries,
- record initial legitimacy and reciprocity state.

Sage role: **diagnostic only**.

---

## Phase 2 — Contained Operation

- operate within declared scope,
- prefer R0 actions; use R1 sparingly,
- slow cadence under uncertainty,
- preserve disagreement and dissent signals.

Sage role:
- drift scanning,
- GR/IC monitoring,
- reversibility reminders.

---

## Phase 3 — Stress & Perturbation Testing

- introduce controlled variability,
- test response to disagreement,
- test response to metric pressure,
- observe delay and coupling effects.

Sage role:
- red-team analysis,
- failure mode surfacing,
- escalation threshold alerts.

---

## Phase 4 — Evaluation & Exit

- assess drift changes,
- assess legitimacy effects,
- assess ethical and reciprocity impact,
- execute rollback or graceful exit.

Sage role:
- reconstruction support,
- learning artifact generation,
- protocol refinement inputs.

---

# ========================================
# 5. Pilot Metrics (Use with Caution)
# ========================================

Pilots may observe metrics, but must **not optimize them**.

Allowed categories:

- drift direction (not targets),
- legitimacy signals (qualitative + quantitative),
- reciprocity balance indicators,
- participation parity signals,
- delay and overload indicators.

Hard rules:

- no single metric justification,
- no automated thresholds,
- no metric-based enforcement.

If GR risk rises → metrics become advisory only.

---

# ========================================
# 6. Oversight & Review Cadence
# ========================================

Pilots require **more oversight**, not less.

Minimum requirements:

- scheduled review windows,
- published rationales,
- visible appeal channels,
- independent observation where feasible.

If oversight weakens, **pilot pauses automatically**.

---

# ========================================
# 7. Common Pilot Failure Modes
# ========================================

Watch for:

- scope creep becoming permanent,
- “temporary” authority extensions,
- metric obsession,
- fatigue-driven compliance,
- symbolic overconfidence,
- success narratives masking harm,
- resistance to rollback.

Sage must flag these immediately.

---

# ========================================
# 8. Exit, Rollback, and Termination
# ========================================

Every pilot must support:

- full rollback,
- partial rollback,
- graceful termination,
- or non-adoption with learning retention.

Exit is **success**, not failure, when:
- legitimacy weakens,
- drift increases,
- ethical risk rises,
- or reversibility erodes.

---

# ========================================
# 9. Post-Pilot Artifacts (Mandatory)
# ========================================

Each pilot produces:

- drift comparison (before / during / after),
- legitimacy impact summary,
- reciprocity effects review,
- GR/IC observations,
- failure and near-miss log,
- recommendations for or against scaling.

Artifacts feed back into:
- protocol updates,
- analytical methods,
- governance design.

---

# ========================================
# 10. Role of RGT Sage in Pilots
# ========================================

RGT Sage may:

- support diagnostics,
- surface risks,
- simulate alternatives,
- structure evaluations.

RGT Sage may **not**:

- approve continuation,
- declare success,
- justify scaling,
- override human judgment.

The final decision always remains human.

---

# ========================================
# 11. Summary

RGT pilots are **learning instruments**, not adoption funnels.

A successful pilot:
- ends cleanly,
- teaches honestly,
- preserves dignity,
- and leaves governance stronger than before.

If a pilot cannot fail safely,  
it should not run.
