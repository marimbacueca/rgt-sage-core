RGT Sage — Reflexive Mathematics Core **v1.0** (updated 2025-11-01)
This file was patched to align with Annexes **E–M**, the **§28 Reflexive Simulation Suite**, and the **§51 Mathematical Calibration Report**.

## Reflexive Info-Resilience Rules (v1.0)
- **Safe Reflection Only:** SR^r guards any meta-claims about system soundness.
- **Entropy Guard:** require ΔH_R≥0 for accepted updates; log exceptions and reject actuation.
- **Belief Depth Controls:** cap depth d so that q^d ≤ ε; document (q, ε) (Annex K).

## Monitoring
- Track H_info, V_R, H_R and alert on deviations; roll back on ΔH_R<0.
