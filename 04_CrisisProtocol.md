# Crisis Protocol (v2.0)

The **Crisis Protocol** governs system behavior under conditions of acute instability, informational collapse, legitimacy erosion, overload, or ε-boundary threats.

It is triggered only when **normal reflexive governance (L0–L3)** is insufficient to maintain stability.  
In crisis, the priority shifts to **preservation of life, legitimacy, reversibility, and coherence.**

---

# 1. Crisis Trigger Conditions

A crisis is declared when **any** of the following conditions are met:

### **1.1 Legitimacy Collapse**
\[
L_t < \tau_L
\]
for two consecutive intervals or a single catastrophic drop.

### **1.2 Drift Acceleration**
\[
\frac{d}{dt}(\text{drift}) > \rho_{\max}
\]
Structural, normative, symbolic, or legitimacy drift increasing faster than corrective capacity.

### **1.3 α/K Envelope Violation**
Unsafe posture detected:
- **K too high** relative to α (over-intensity under low understanding), or  
- **α too low** relative to K (insensitivity to risk).

### **1.4 ε-Boundary Pressure**
Signals indicate a risk of:
- identity destabilization,  
- institutional incoherence,  
- irreversible harm.

### **1.5 Information Breakdown (L0)**
- provenance collapse,  
- missing critical signals,  
- contradictory narratives,  
- symbolic fragmentation.

### **1.6 Metabolic Overload**
Sustained compression → exhaustion, error rates → legitimacy decline.

# 2. Immediate Response (First 24 Hours)

When crisis is recognized, the system must pivot from **optimization** to **protection**.

## **2.1 Rights Gate Activation (R\*)**
Immediately halt any actions violating core invariants:
- human rights,  
- procedural fairness,  
- essential liberties,  
- baseline protections.

No exception exists.

## **2.2 Cadence & Intensity Limiter**
Adjust α/K to **safe posture**:

\[
K \rightarrow 0.6K,\quad \alpha \rightarrow 1.3\alpha
\]

Goal: increase sensitivity, reduce intensity.

Activate **Crisis Dampener** through RDL-2 and RDL-3.

## **2.3 Reversibility Lock**
All irreversible decisions are:
- **frozen**,  
- **rerouted to RDL-4 (simulation)**,  
- **subject to expanded oversight**.

## **2.4 Context Isolation**
Prevent context overlap:

- Return each decision to its native domain.  
- Remove “borrowed logic” (police → welfare; military → civic admin; etc.).  

## **2.5 Information Triage**
Classify signals by:
- quality,  
- reliability,  
- uncertainty,  
- symbolic meaning.

Low-quality signals → downgraded automatically.

## **2.6 System Metabolism Reset**
Reduce decision throughput:
- cancel noncritical tasks,  
- enforce integration pauses,  
- slow execution cycles.

---

# 3. Stabilization Phase (24h–7 days)

The goal is to **stop destabilization** and restore minimum reflexive capacity.

## **3.1 Drift Sentry Mode (RDL-1)**
Increase drift sampling frequency.  
Detect:
- symbolic contradictions,  
- legitimacy ruptures,  
- fairness deviations,  
- cognitive fragmentation.

## **3.2 Governance Cooling**
Shift majority of governance to **Presence Mode**:
- scenario scanning,  
- deliberation,  
- reconnection with ground truth.

No fast decisions except safety-related.

## **3.3 Symbolic Field Repair**
Re-align narratives, imagery, and communication to restore:
- meaning coherence,  
- shared orientation,  
- emotional stability.

Symbolic drift is treated as a structural risk.

## **3.4 Fairness–Legitimacy Floor Protection**
Fairness must be stabilized.  
By Theorem L1:
\[
\Delta L \ge \gamma_f \Delta F
\]
Even small fairness gains → large legitimacy gains.

## **3.5 Participation Parity Monitoring**
Using Theorem P1:
- ensure update rate β remains stable,  
- prevent exclusion dynamics,  
- maintain minimum inclusion guarantees.

---

# 4. Recovery Phase (7–30 days)

The goal is to rebuild capacities and transition back to normal governance.

## **4.1 α/K Normalization**
Gradually restore α/K to stable pre-crisis envelope.

## **4.2 Reopen Reversibility Corridor**
Actions previously paused are:
- reassessed,  
- reclassified,  
- returned to governance channels.

Irreversible actions must go through full ethical gatekeeping.

## **4.3 Governance Re-Expansion**
Shift gradually from Presence Mode → Articulation Mode.

Rebuild:
- decision throughput,  
- multi-objective balancing (RDL-5),  
- institutional cadence.

## **4.4 Symbolic/Aesthetic Integration**
Use aesthetic mediation (Theorem M1):
\[
\frac{\partial L}{\partial B} > 0
\]
By improving symbolic clarity → restore meaning coherence → increase legitimacy.

## **4.5 metabolic cadence rebalancing**
Return cognitive–institutional load to:
- steady rhythm,  
- predictable cycles,  
- human-aligned pace.

---

# 5. Re-Entry to Normal Governance

### **5.1 Exit Conditions**
Normal operations resume when:

- \(L_t\) stabilizes above threshold  
- drift indices normalize  
- ε-pressure disappears  
- provenance restored  
- symbolic coherence recovered  
- α/K within envelope  
- no pending irreversible threats  

### **5.2 Post-Crisis Audit (mandatory)**
Using the **Audit & Logging v2.0** system:
- reconstruct crisis timeline  
- evaluate decision quality  
- assess ethical posture  
- detect improvement opportunities  
- update crisis protocols accordingly  

### **5.3 Update RDL Parameters**
Stabilize:
- \(g_\ell\) loop gains,  
- α/K internal schedules,  
- drift thresholds,  
- metabolic buffers.

---

# 6. Mathematical Guarantees (v2.0)

### **T1 — GRST-v2.0**
If composite operator \(F(\cdot;\alpha,K)\) remains in stability region → drift bounded.

### **T2 — α/K Envelope**
Unsafe α/K posture → crisis;  
envelope tightening restores stability.

### **T3 — Small-Gain Stability**
If:
\[
\|F_0\| + \sum_\ell g_\ell < 1
\]
layered control remains stable.

### **T4 — Fairness→Legitimacy Lower Bound**
\[
\Delta L \ge \gamma_f \Delta F
\]

### **T5 — Participation Parity**
If \(L_h < 1\), then \(p_t \to p^\*\).

### **T6 — Aesthetic Mediation**
\[
\frac{\partial L}{\partial B} > 0
\]

---

# 7. Summary

The Crisis Protocol is the **emergency reflexivity module** of RGT v2.0.

It emphasizes:
- immediate protection of rights,  
- symbolic coherence,  
- information integrity,  
- α/K safety posture,  
- reversibility,  
- metabolic balance,  
- and legitimacy restoration.

A system must not return to normal governance until it can **learn faster than it destabilizes** again.
