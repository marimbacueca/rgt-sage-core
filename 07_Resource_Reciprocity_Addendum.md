# Resource Reciprocity Addendum (v2.0)

Resource reciprocity is the principle that **flows of resources, benefits, responsibilities, risks, meaning, and burden** must remain **mutually reinforcing, transparently balanced, ethically bounded, and dynamically fair** across the entire governance ecosystem.

This v2.0 framework integrates:

- the **L0–L4 architecture**,  
- **α/K ethical stability**,  
- **Safety Envelope v2.0**,  
- **Reflexive Data Loops**,  
- **drift indices**,  
- **fairness–legitimacy dynamics**,  
- **symbolic and narrative reciprocity**,  
- **metabolic load considerations**,  
- and **reversibility constraints**.

---

# 1. Purpose of Resource Reciprocity

Reciprocity ensures:
- legitimacy remains stable,  
- fairness does not decay,  
- symbolic/meaning coherence remains intact,  
- governance remains non-extractive,  
- burdens are not hidden,  
- benefits and risks remain ethically proportional,  
- the system maintains long-term stability.

When reciprocity fails → **legitimacy drift** accelerates and α/K stability deteriorates.

---

# 2. Four Domains of Reciprocity (v2.0)

Resource flows occur in four interconnected domains:

---

## **2.1 Material Reciprocity**
Distribution of tangible assets:
- funding  
- infrastructure  
- labor  
- physical resources  
- time  
- access  

Material asymmetry → fairness drift → legitimacy decline.

---

## **2.2 Informational Reciprocity**
Distribution of:
- data  
- insight  
- interpretive capacity  
- epistemic burden  
- provenance clarity  

One-sided information control = L0 gap → L2 instability → governance drift.

---

## **2.3 Symbolic Reciprocity**
Distribution of:
- meaning,  
- recognition,  
- cultural capital,  
- narrative alignment,  
- symbolic representation.

Symbolic extraction (taking identity/perception benefits without offering meaning back) → symbolic drift → trust collapse.

---

## **2.4 Metabolic Reciprocity**
Distribution of cognitive–emotional load:
- decision density  
- urgency burden  
- execution pressure  
- interpretive fatigue  
- expectation management

Load asymmetry → metabolic drift → instability → increased K → α/K envelope violation.

---

# 3. Reciprocity Conditions (v2.0)

A relationship is reciprocal when all four of the following conditions are met.

---

## **3.1 Transparency Condition**
All parties understand:
- contributions,  
- benefits,  
- tradeoffs,  
- risks,  
- reversibility class,  
- symbolic meaning.

Opacity → L0 drift → legitimacy loss.

---

## **3.2 Proportionality Condition**
Contributions and benefits must be **ethically proportional**:
\[
\text{Benefit}_i \sim \text{Contribution}_i
\]
with adjustments for:
- historical inequalities,  
- structural imbalances,  
- systemic biases.

---

## **3.3 Meaning Coherence Condition**
Symbolic value must reinforce mutual recognition and identity coherence.

A system cannot extract symbolic value without offering meaning back.

---

## **3.4 Metabolic Fairness Condition**
Load must be shared fairly:
- high-load phases must rotate,  
- integration pauses must be protected,  
- no group can be permanently compressed.

---

# 4. Reciprocity Failure Modes (v2.0)

Reciprocity fails through five primary pathways:

---

## **4.1 Extractive Reciprocity**
One party absorbs benefits while externalizing:
- risk,  
- load,  
- symbolic harm,  
- or informational burden.

Causes:
- fairness drift,  
- metabolic overload,  
- symbolic resentment.

---

## **4.2 Asymmetric Information Burden**
One party carries the interpretive labor:
- clarifying context,  
- reconciling narratives,  
- explaining meaning,  
- providing situational awareness.

Creates L1–L2 instability: system becomes **insensitive** and **over-intense** (low α, high K).

---

## **4.3 Meaning Divergence**
Symbolic narratives stop aligning:
- competing frames,  
- contradictory imaginaries,  
- absence of shared story.

Leads to **symbolic drift**, which destabilizes legitimacy.

---

## **4.4 Reversibility Imbalance**
One group faces irreversible consequences while others face reversible ones.

Violates:
- Safety Envelope,  
- α/K envelope,  
- fairness–legitimacy theorem.

---

## **4.5 Chronic Load Imbalance**
One group bears perpetual:
- urgency,  
- emotional load,  
- institutional stress.

Results in:
- metabolic drift,  
- cognitive fragmentation,  
- legitimacy collapse.

# 5. Reciprocity Metrics (Cross-Linked to Metrics Appendix)

### **5.1 Material Reciprocity Score (MRS)**
Fairness of resource distribution.

### **5.2 Informational Reciprocity Score (IRS)**
Equality of epistemic access & interpretive labor.

### **5.3 Symbolic Reciprocity Score (SRS)**
Degree of shared narrative and representation.

### **5.4 Metabolic Reciprocity Score (MeRS)**
Balance of decision load, urgency, execution pressure.

Each scaled **0–1**.

Low scores → activate RDL-1, RDL-2, RDL-8.

---

# 6. Reciprocity & the α/K Envelope

Reciprocity affects α/K posture:

- High reciprocity → stable α/K  
- Low reciprocity → raise α, lower K  
- Extreme asymmetry → envelope violation → Crisis Protocol

Mathematically:
\[
\frac{\partial (\alpha/K)}{\partial R} > 0
\]

---

# 7. Reciprocity & Legitimacy

Reciprocity reinforces legitimacy:

\[
\Delta L \ge \gamma_r \Delta R
\]

with γᵣ ≈ 0.3–0.6 depending on context.

Symbolic reciprocity strongly influences meaning coherence Cₜ:
\[
\frac{\partial L}{\partial B} > 0
\]

---

# 8. Reciprocity Interventions (Corrective Actions)

### **8.1 Redistribution (Material)**
Reallocate resources to restore proportionality.

### **8.2 Rebalancing (Informational)**
Ensure:
- shared interpretive responsibility,  
- transparent data flows,  
- shared epistemic burden.

### **8.3 Re-alignment (Symbolic)**
Repair narrative and aesthetic coherence.

### **8.4 Rest Cycling (Metabolic)**
Introduce:
- integration pauses,  
- decompression cycles,  
- load rotation.

# 9. Reciprocity & Reflexive Data Loops

Reciprocity integrates into RDLs as follows:

| RDL | Reciprocity Role |
|------|------------------|
| **RDL-1** | Detects reciprocity-driven drift |
| **RDL-2** | Low reciprocity → reduce K |
| **RDL-3** | Increase α to interpret imbalance |
| **RDL-4** | Simulates impacts of asymmetric actions |
| **RDL-5** | Balances reciprocity against conflicting objectives |
| **RDL-6** | Tests high-risk reciprocity failures on contained populations |
| **RDL-7** | Ensures reversibility evaluation |
| **RDL-8** | Balances metabolic load |

---

# 10. Summary

Reciprocity is a **structural condition for stability**.

In RGT v2.0:

- Fairness is the *moral foundation*.  
- Legitimacy is the *structural outcome*.  
- Reciprocity is the *circulatory system*.  
- α/K is the *ethical stabilizer*.  
- Symbolic coherence is the *meaning anchor*.  
- Metabolic balance is the *sustainability constraint*.  

Without reciprocity, a system cannot remain stable, legitimate, or reflexive.
