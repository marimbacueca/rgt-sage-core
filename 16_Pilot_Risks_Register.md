# Pilot Risks Register (v2.0)

This register enumerates the **full spectrum of risks** that may arise during the Municipal Permitting Pilot under **RGT v2.0**, linking each risk to its:

- RGT layer (L0–L4)  
- Safety Envelope constraint  
- α/K stability implications  
- Drift acceleration potential  
- Reversibility class  
- Symbolic and metabolic impact  
- Required Reflexive Data Loop(s)  
- Mitigation protocol  

The register supports the **Pilot Dashboard** and informs oversight through **Audit & Logging v2.0**.

# 1. Risk Categories (v2.0)

Risks fall into seven major categories:

1. **Information Risks (L0)**  
2. **Index and Drift Risks (L1)**  
3. **Control Risks (L2, α/K)**  
4. **Governance & Legitimacy Risks (L3)**  
5. **Symbolic & Meaning Risks**  
6. **Metabolic Overload Risks**  
7. **Reversibility & Irreversibility Risks (Safety Envelope)**  

Each category includes early-warning signals and required RDL pathways.

| R-R3 | Failure to Escalate | Any | 6 | Critical | Automatic escalation |

---

# 3. Early-Warning Indicators

The following signals predict instability:

- α/K drift toward edges of envelope  
- SCI downward trend  
- multiple drift indices rising together  
- metabolic load >0.75 for 3 consecutive cycles  
- narrative contradictions in public communication  
- fairness drop (Fₜ < 0.6)  
- envelope violation sequences  
- D' (drift acceleration) > 0.15  
- mode drift (Articulation Mode during high ambiguity)  

Early-warning signals must be logged and escalated.

---

# 4. Safety Envelope v2.0 Triggers

A risk becomes a **Safety Envelope violation** when:

- ε-pressure ≥0.6  
- irreversible action attempted under low coherence  
- context overlap detected in a high-stakes decision  
- ethical uncertainty ≥0.5  
- metabolic overload persistent  
- α/K envelope breached  
- RDL non-contractive loops detected  

Violations automatically:

- freeze irreversible actions,  
- escalate to oversight,  
- activate RDL-4 and RDL-6 components,  
- increase α and reduce K,  
- slow decision cadence.

---

# 5. Mitigation Framework

Mitigation uses the following components:

- **RDL-1**: Drift reduction  
- **RDL-2**: Lower K  
- **RDL-3**: Raise α  
- **RDL-4**: Simulation  
- **RDL-5**: Multi-objective balancing  
- **RDL-6**: Canary testing  
- **RDL-7**: Reversibility mapping  
- **RDL-8**: Load and cadence stabilization  

In all cases, the corrective goal is to **restore envelope compliance**, stabilize drift, and bring the system back into reversible, legitimate operation.

---

# 6. Summary

This Pilot Risks Register provides the **reflexive safety backbone** for the municipal permitting pilot under RGT v2.0.

A system cannot remain stable unless it:

- sees risks early,  
- interprets them correctly,  
- adjusts α/K ethically,  
- preserves fairness and legitimacy,  
- protects reversibility,  
- maintains symbolic coherence,  
- prevents overload,  
- and uses RDL loops contractively.

Reflexive governance is not risk-free — but it is **risk-literate** and structurally capable of learning faster than it destabilizes.
