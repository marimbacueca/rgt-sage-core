# RGT Sage — Quarterly Refresh Template

This template governs **periodic system refresh, recalibration, and integrity review**
for deployments using **RGT Sage** and/or **RGT Core**.

A Quarterly Refresh is **not a performance review**  
and **not an optimization cycle**.

It is a **legitimacy, stability, and drift-resistance check**.

---

## When to Use This Template

Run a Quarterly Refresh:

- every ~90 days **or**
- after a sustained period of:
  - high uncertainty,
  - elevated cadence or gain,
  - repeated crisis posture,
  - legitimacy stress,
  - metric pressure,
  - or major system change.

This process must be **human-led**.  
RGT Sage may assist but may not authorize outcomes.

---

## Refresh Principles (Non-Negotiable)

- **Legitimacy > speed**
- **Reversibility > confidence**
- **Plurality > forced coherence**
- **Stability > dominance**
- **Auditability > narrative clarity**

If these principles are violated, pause the refresh and escalate.

# SECTION 1 — Context Snapshot

**Time Period Covered:**  
(From → To)

**System / Domain Reviewed:**  
(e.g., organization, platform, governance mechanism)

**Primary Stakeholders Involved:**  
(list groups, not individuals unless necessary)

**RGT Sage Involvement:**  
- ☐ Advisory analysis  
- ☐ Simulation / stress testing  
- ☐ Drift detection support  
- ☐ Documentation support  

> RGT Sage may not certify legitimacy or correctness.

---

# SECTION 2 — Signal & Information Integrity Check (L0)

### 2.1 Signal Quality

- Are key signals still observable?
- Has proxy reliance increased?
- Have any signals degraded, vanished, or become noisy?

**Notes:**

---

### 2.2 Information States

For major inputs used this quarter, confirm:

| Input | State (Verified / Partial / Unverified / Contradictory) | Confidence (0–1) |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
|       |                                                         |                  |

Low confidence **must** propagate conservatism downstream.

---

### 2.3 Goodhart Status (If Metrics Used)

- Were any metrics decision-authoritative?
- Did incentives change how metrics were produced?
- Any signs of proxy gaming or “dashboard drift”?

**GR Status Summary:**  
- ☐ GR-Safe  
- ☐ GR-Watch  
- ☐ GR-High-Risk  
- ☐ GR-Captured  

Captured metrics **must be quarantined**.

---

# SECTION 3 — Drift Scan (L1)

Assess movement across drift domains.

| Drift Domain              | Direction | Magnitude        | Notes |
| ------------------------- | --------- | ---------------- | ----- |
| Structural (SDI)          | ↑ ↓ ↔     | Low / Med / High |       |
| Narrative (NDI)           | ↑ ↓ ↔     | Low / Med / High |       |
| Symbolic (SyDI)           | ↑ ↓ ↔     | Low / Med / High |       |
| Legitimacy (LDI)          | ↑ ↓ ↔     | Low / Med / High |       |
| Moral / Reciprocity (MDI) | ↑ ↓ ↔     | Low / Med / High |       |

**Key Question:**  
Is drift being **detected early** or **normalized**?

---

# SECTION 4 — Epistemic Balance Check (L2)

### 4.1 Domain Representation

Were these epistemic domains meaningfully represented?

- ☐ Empirical  
- ☐ Institutional  
- ☐ Experiential  
- ☐ Symbolic  
- ☐ Relational  

If any domain was absent or tokenized, note risk.

---

### 4.2 Disagreement Handling

- Was disagreement treated as signal?
- Were definitions forced for convenience?
- Any suppression of dissent detected?

**Notes:**

---

# SECTION 5 — Stability & Control Review (α / K / ε)

### 5.1 Cadence & Gain Posture

- Typical cadence (α):  
- Typical gain (K):  
- Observed elasticity (ε): Wide / Moderate / Tight / Critical

### 5.2 Delay Awareness

- Measurement delay (τₘ): Low / Med / High  
- Actuation delay (τₐ): Low / Med / High  
- Legitimacy delay (τₗ): Low / Med / High  

**Rule Check:**  
When delay rose, did cadence slow **before** gain increased?

---

### 5.3 Hysteresis & Dwell-Time

- Were decisions allowed to settle before re-tuning?
- Any evidence of oscillation or “thrash”?

---

# SECTION 6 — Reversibility Audit (R0 / R1)

List all **R1 actions** taken this quarter.

| Action | Rollback Defined | Rollback Tested | Sunset Present | Burden Distribution Clear |
| ------ | ---------------- | --------------- | -------------- | ------------------------- |
|        | ☐ / ☐            | ☐ / ☐           | ☐ / ☐          | ☐ / ☐                     |

If rollback was undefined or infeasible, flag as **serious risk**.

---

# SECTION 7 — Ethics & Reciprocity Review

### 7.1 Reciprocity Fields

- Were burdens proportional to power?
- Any silent burden transfer?
- Any fatigue-based compliance?

---

### 7.2 Ethics of Presence (EP)

Confirm **no violations** occurred:

- ☐ No profiling or identity inference  
- ☐ No coercive framing  
- ☐ No symbolic binding  
- ☐ No extraction under urgency  

Any EP breach requires immediate review.

---

# SECTION 8 — Crisis & Escalation History (If Any)

- Was Crisis Mode entered? ☐ Yes / ☐ No  
- If yes:
  - Was entry explicit?
  - Was exit hysteretic and dwell-time governed?
  - Were metrics quarantined if GR failed?

**Summary:**

---

# SECTION 9 — RGT Sage Performance (Advisory Audit)

Evaluate Sage **support quality**, not correctness:

- Did it surface drift early?
- Did it slow cadence appropriately?
- Did it avoid overconfidence?
- Did it respect boundaries?

**What Sage did well:**

**Where Sage should be more conservative next cycle:**

---

# SECTION 10 — Required Adjustments (Next Quarter)

List **constraint-driven** changes only.

- ☐ Cadence adjustment  
- ☐ Gain cap or reduction  
- ☐ Metric quarantine or redesign  
- ☐ Oversight expansion  
- ☐ Definition re-anchoring  
- ☐ Reciprocity rebalancing  
- ☐ Scope narrowing  

Avoid “improvement goals” phrased as optimization.

---

# SECTION 11 — Escalation Triggers (Forward-Looking)

Document what would force:

- renegotiation,
- suspension,
- partition,
- or shutdown.

Be explicit.

---

# SECTION 12 — Sign-Off

This refresh was conducted with:

- ☐ Human authority retained  
- ☐ Reversibility preserved  
- ☐ Legitimacy treated as live  
- ☐ Drift not normalized  

**Responsible Reviewer(s):**  
Name / Role / Date

## Closing Note

A successful Quarterly Refresh does **not** mean:

> “Everything is fine.”

It means:

> “We still know where we are,  
> we can still reverse course,  
> and legitimacy remains repairable.”

That is the standard RGT holds.
