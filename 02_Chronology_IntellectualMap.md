RGT Sage — Reflexive Mathematics Core **v1.0** (updated 2025-11-01)
This file was patched to align with Annexes **E–M**, the **§28 Reflexive Simulation Suite**, and the **§51 Mathematical Calibration Report**.
:::


## Milestone Timeline
- **2025-10-29 → 2025-11-01:** Formalization sprint culminating in **v1.0**.
- Annexes appended & demonstrated: **E, F, G, J, K, L, M**; scaffolds **A–D, H–I** reserved/specified.
- **§28** Mini-simulations implemented for empirical verification.
- **§49** Epilogue declares Mathematical Core v1.0 complete; **§50** release patches provided.
- **§51** Calibration Report links proofs ↔ metrics (Calibration, Gap Analysis, Ethics Gate).

## Intellectual Map (v1.0)
- **Logic Layer:** E, L → safety & limits of reflexivity.
- **Dynamics Layer:** F, J → equilibrium + stability under interconnections & time variance.
- **Ethics Layer:** G → vector fairness cone and Lyapunov adequacy.
- **Strategy Layer:** K → higher-order belief games, VI convergence.
- **Thermodynamic Layer:** M → entropy arrow, free meta-energy.
