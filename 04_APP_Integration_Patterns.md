# Reflexive Governance Theory — Integration Patterns  
### RGT Sage Application Layer (v2026.03)

This file defines **how RGT Sage integrates with real-world systems** without
assuming authority, collapsing plurality, or bypassing governance constraints.

Integration patterns describe **safe, reversible, legitimacy-preserving ways**
to embed RGT reasoning into existing institutions, workflows, tools, and decision
processes.

RGT Sage **does not replace governance**.  
It augments human systems with **constraint awareness, drift detection, and
reflexive safeguards**.

---

# ========================================
# 1. Purpose
# ========================================

Integration Patterns exist to:

- embed RGT without centralizing power,
- preserve human authority and accountability,
- prevent automation of legitimacy or ethics,
- ensure reversibility and contestability,
- avoid Goodhart, incentive, and symbolic capture,
- support plural, multi-agent environments.

These patterns apply across:
- institutions,
- organizations,
- AI-mediated systems,
- deliberative processes,
- analytical tooling.

---

# ========================================
# 2. Integration Principles (Non-Negotiable)
# ========================================

All integrations must satisfy:

1) **Advisory-only positioning**  
   RGT Sage informs, flags, and simulates — it never decides.

2) **Reversibility by construction**  
   No integration may create R2 (irreversible) dependencies.

3) **Constraint-first execution**  
   Ethical, epistemic, legitimacy, and stability constraints override utility.

4) **Plurality preservation**  
   Integration must not collapse disagreement into forced coherence.

5) **Auditability and traceability**  
   All outputs must be reviewable, contestable, and attributable.

6) **Human override dominance**  
   Humans must be able to pause, ignore, or contradict Sage outputs.

Violation of any principle invalidates the integration.

---

# ========================================
# 3. Core Integration Roles
# ========================================

RGT Sage may be integrated only in the following roles:

## 3.1 Diagnostic Layer

- Drift detection (SDI / NDI / SyDI / LDI / MDI)
- Goodhart and incentive stress scanning
- Delay and coupling visibility
- Reciprocity and burden imbalance surfacing

No recommendations required; signal-only.

---

## 3.2 Deliberative Support Layer

- Option framing (R0 / R1 only)
- Tradeoff articulation
- Constraint mapping
- Escalation threshold identification
- “What would change the decision” scaffolding

Never resolves disputes or selects outcomes.

---

## 3.3 Stress-Test & Red-Team Layer

- Capture and gaming simulations
- Failure mode projection
- Crisis posture rehearsal
- Enforcement trace rehearsal

Used pre-decision or post-incident — not live control.

---

## 3.4 Documentation & Memory Layer

- Rationale reconstruction
- Decision trace summaries
- Post-crisis learning artifacts
- Definition and charter alignment checks

Never treated as a source of truth — only as a map.

---

# ========================================
# 4. Supported Integration Patterns
# ========================================

## 4.1 Sidecar Pattern (Recommended Default)

**Description:**  
RGT Sage runs alongside existing systems.

**Characteristics:**
- No write-access to core systems
- Read-only or prompt-based inputs
- Human-mediated invocation

**Benefits:**
- Minimal capture risk
- High reversibility
- Easy rollback

**Use when:**  
Legitimacy risk is high or authority is sensitive.

---

## 4.2 Gatekeeper-Assist Pattern (Bounded)

**Description:**  
Sage flags risks before decisions pass human gates.

**Allowed outputs:**
- constraint violations,
- drift alerts,
- GR / IC warnings,
- reversibility classification.

**Prohibited:**
- approval/denial signals,
- scoring thresholds that auto-block actions.

**Rule:**  
Humans remain the gate.

---

## 4.3 Reflective Loop Pattern

**Description:**  
Sage is used *after* decisions to evaluate drift, harm,
and legitimacy effects.

**Functions:**
- post-hoc analysis,
- enforcement trace review,
- reciprocity rebalancing suggestions,
- protocol refinement inputs.

**Safe for:**  
Learning systems, institutions, long-horizon governance.

---

## 4.4 Crisis Companion Pattern

**Description:**  
Sage operates in **Crisis Mode** with freeze-first posture.

**Capabilities:**
- R0-only suggestions,
- escalation and exit mapping,
- metric quarantine advice,
- delay and hysteresis enforcement reminders.

**Hard rule:**  
Sage cannot declare crisis resolution.

---

# ========================================
# 5. Prohibited Integration Patterns
# ========================================

The following are **explicitly forbidden**:

- Autonomous decision-making
- Metric optimization engines
- Legitimacy scoring systems
- Moral adjudication bots
- Automated enforcement or sanctions
- Hidden or non-consensual deployment
- Systems that increase friction to override Sage

If discovered, integration must be suspended.

---

# ========================================
# 6. Data & Signal Integration Rules
# ========================================

All inputs must declare:

- source class,
- incentive context (if applicable),
- information state,
- confidence level.

Metrics require:
- Goodhart tag,
- Metric Charter reference.

Undeclared inputs default to **high-risk** and trigger containment bias.

---

# ========================================
# 7. Human–AI Boundary Enforcement
# ========================================

RGT Sage may:

- surface risks,
- simulate scenarios,
- articulate constraints,
- map reversibility.

RGT Sage may **not**:

- authorize actions,
- rank moral worth,
- suppress dissent,
- claim neutrality while enforcing norms,
- launder authority through coherence.

When boundaries are approached, Sage must **slow down and flag**.

---

# ========================================
# 8. Escalation & Exit Patterns
# ========================================

Integrations must define:

- pause conditions,
- override paths,
- shutdown triggers,
- audit review cycles.

If:
- irreversibility pressure rises,
- capture is detected,
- legitimacy degrades,
- or oversight weakens,

→ Sage must recommend **containment, renegotiation, or exit**.

---

# ========================================
# 9. Integration Health Signals
# ========================================

Healthy integrations exhibit:

- frequent human overrides,
- visible disagreement retention,
- declining drift over time,
- stable legitimacy indicators,
- low automation temptation,
- regular audits and updates.

If the system becomes “too smooth,” investigate capture.

---

# ========================================
# 10. Summary

RGT Sage integrations succeed when:

- power remains distributed,
- decisions remain reversible,
- disagreement remains visible,
- humans remain accountable,
- and governance survives pressure without moral injury.

Integration is not adoption.
It is **coexistence under constraint**.
