# Crosslinks Index (v2.0)

This index provides a **high-level map** of the RGT Sage Core files.  
Each number corresponds to a logical “slot” in the architecture, independent of specific version suffixes in filenames.

> **Note:**  
> Filenames may still contain legacy suffixes (e.g., `_v1_0`, `_v1_1`, `_v3_6_1`).  
> The **canonical version is defined in the YAML `version:` field inside each file**, not in the filename.

## 17 — This File: Crosslinks Index

- **17 → crosslinks index (you are here)**  
  `17_Crosslinks_Index.md` (content now v2.0)  
  Role:
  - provides a conceptual map of the corpus,
  - clarifies the role of each numbered file,
  - decouples file role from any specific version suffix,
  - should be updated whenever:
    - new modules are added,
    - major roles shift,
    - file naming conventions change.

---

## Maintenance Notes

- **Versioning**  
  - Filenames may **optionally** retain suffixes for legacy reasons.  
  - The **source of truth** for version is the YAML `version:` field in each file.

- **Renaming**  
  - If filenames are later renamed (e.g., dropping `_v1_0`),  
    this index still holds as long as the **logical roles (00–17 slots)** do not change.  
  - When roles change, update this file accordingly.

- **Tooling**  
  - RGT Sage and related agents should rely on:
    - this Crosslinks Index,
    - YAML frontmatter,
    - and the Metrics & Glossary files  
    as canonical sources of structure.
