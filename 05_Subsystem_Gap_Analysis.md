# Subsystem Gap Analysis (v2.0)

This document identifies and analyzes the **gaps, misalignments, or instability vectors** within any governed system through the lens of **Reflexive Governance Theory (RGT)**.

It is aligned with the **RGT System Architecture v0.2** and uses the updated frameworks:

- L0–L4 layer model  
- α/K Stability Envelope  
- Reflexive Data Loops (RDLs) v2.0  
- Drift Indices (structural, normative, symbolic, legitimacy, metabolic)  
- Safety Envelope v2.0 (ε-boundary, context overlap, ethical uncertainty, metabolic overload)  
- Fairness–Legitimacy bounds  
- Meaning & Symbolic Coherence  
- Reversibility classes  
- Mode-sensitive governance  

The goal is to detect gaps **before they destabilize the system**, allowing corrective action while the system remains within the Reflexive Stability Envelope.

# 1. Purpose of the Gap Analysis

The Gap Analysis provides:

### **1.1 Early-warning detection**
Identifies discrepancies between intended system design and actual operation.

### **1.2 Cross-layer diagnosis**
Reveals where instability originates:
- L0 (information),  
- L1 (indices),  
- L2 (control),  
- L3 (governance),  
- L4 (agent/human interface).

### **1.3 Drift classification**
Maps gaps to drift types:
- structural,  
- normative,  
- symbolic,  
- legitimacy,  
- metabolic.

### **1.4 Safety Envelope evaluation**
Assesses whether system actions are safely within:
- ethical constraints,  
- α/K envelope,  
- reversibility corridor,  
- context boundaries,  
- metabolic limits.

### **1.5 System continuity**
Ensures the system can **learn faster than it destabilizes**.

---

# 2. Definitions

### **Gap**
A mismatch between:
- system design,  
- system operation,  
- or system perception.

A gap becomes dangerous when it produces drift or crosses the Safety Envelope.

### **Subsystem**
A coherent operational unit (policy domain, process, department, loop, or layer) with defined responsibilities.

### **Risk Surface**
The combination of:
- stakes,  
- load,  
- uncertainty,  
- reversibility class,  
- and symbolic meaning  
associated with a subsystem.

### **Critical Gap**
A gap likely to destabilize the subsystem or whole system within the next decision cycles.

---

# 3. Gap Categories (v2.0)

Gaps are classified according to the layer in which they originate.

---

## **3.1 L0 Gaps — Data & Provenance**

### **L0-G1: Provenance Opacity**
Missing source identity, transformation chain, uncertainty bounds.

### **L0-G2: Signal Quality Degradation**
High noise, poor resolution, outdated data.

### **L0-G3: Context Mismatch**
Signals inappropriately ported across domains (context overlap).

### **L0-G4: Symbolic/Meaning Collapse**
Narratives or imagery generating contradictory signals.

**Impact:** Weakens α settings, destabilizes drift detection, increases ethical uncertainty.

---

## **3.2 L1 Gaps — Indices, Drift & State**

### **L1-G1: Drift Blindness**
Indices fail to detect structural or symbolic drift.

### **L1-G2: Legitimacy Misread**
Underestimating legitimacy decline due to symbolic or fairness factors.

### **L1-G3: Metabolic Blind Spot**
Ignoring over-compression or overload.

### **L1-G4: Index Fragmentation**
Indices that disagree without explanation → cognitive fragmentation.

**Impact:** Misdiagnosis of system state → unsafe α/K choices.

---

## **3.3 L2 Gaps — Reflexive Control (α/K + RDLs)**

### **L2-G1: α/K Envelope Violation**
Unsafe intensity/sensitivity posture.

### **L2-G2: RDL Non-contraction**
Loops that amplify instability rather than dampen it.

### **L2-G3: Overuse of Irreversible Actions**
K-driven execution without sensitivity to reversibility class.

### **L2-G4: Lack of Simulation**
Governance bypasses RDL-4 (off-policy evaluation).

**Impact:** Destabilization of closed-loop dynamics.

---

## **3.4 L3 Gaps — Governance & Votation**

### **L3-G1: Reversibility Failure**
Irreversible actions taken at low fairness/legitimacy.

### **L3-G2: Participation Parity Distortion**
Exclusion of groups → drift and legitimacy collapse.

### **L3-G3: Procedural Opacity**
Stakeholders cannot see how decisions are made.

### **L3-G4: Symbolic Mismatch**
Governance decisions contradict narratives or meaning structures.

**Impact:** Legitimacy erosion and governance drift.

---

## **3.5 L4 Gaps — Sage/Agent Interface**

### **L4-G1: Mode Misalignment**
Using Articulation Mode during exploratory or high-uncertainty phases.

### **L4-G2: Missing Consent/Escalation**
Agent uses personal or sensitive priors without explicit consent.

### **L4-G3: Safety Envelope Blindness**
Agent fails to flag ε-boundary, context overlap, or overload.

### **L4-G4: Explanation Failure**
Opaque reasoning → loss of trust and reflexive capacity.

**Impact:** Human-AI partnership breakdown.

# 5. Safety Envelope v2.0 Integration

Each gap must be evaluated against the Safety Envelope:

### **5.1 Epsilon-Boundary (ε)**
Does the gap threaten:
- identity,  
- institutional coherence,  
- or social stability?

If yes → escalate immediately.

---

### **5.2 Context Overlap**
Is logic from one domain being misapplied in another?

If yes → isolate domains.

---

### **5.3 Ethical Uncertainty**
Is the system unable to detect harm or evaluate risk?

If yes → raise α, reduce K, invoke RDL-3.

---

### **5.4 Metabolic Overload**
Does the gap increase system load beyond sustainable cadence?

If yes → reduce decision throughput, widen integration pauses.

---

# 6. Reversibility Analysis

Each gap must be classified by reversibility:

- **Reversible** — can be addressed without long-term damage.  
- **Partially Reversible** — correction has costs.  
- **Irreversible** — must be prevented; cannot be undone.

Irreversible gaps (typically L2-G3, L3-G1) require:
- governance freeze,  
- full RDL-4 simulation,  
- expanded oversight,  
- ε-boundary checks.

---

# 7. Intervention Pathways

### **7.1 Information Restoration (L0)**
Rebuild provenance, recalibrate indices, restore symbolic coherence.

### **7.2 Drift Correction (L1)**
Recompute drift indices; realign fairness, legitimacy, and consensus fields.

### **7.3 α/K Envelope Adjustment (L2)**
Strengthen sensitivity, reduce intensity, stabilize reflexive loops.

### **7.4 Governance Safeguarding (L3)**
Increase procedural transparency; prioritize reversible decisions.

### **7.5 Agent Alignment (L4)**
Ensure Sage:
- uses correct modes,  
- respects consent rules,  
- maintains Safety Envelope vigilance.

---

# 8. Minimal Remediation Standard

A subsystem cannot be considered stable unless:

- drift indices are normalized,  
- α/K is within safe envelope,  
- reversibility corridor is respected,  
- fairness + legitimacy metrics stabilizing,  
- symbolic meaning restored,  
- information provenance complete,  
- RDL loops contractive.

---

# 9. Summary

Subsystem gaps are the **fault lines** of governance.

In RGT v2.0:

- gaps are drift vectors,  
- drift drives instability,  
- instability triggers Safety Envelope checks,  
- Safety Envelope protects reversibility and legitimacy,  
- legitimacy makes governance sustainable.

The task of the Subsystem Gap Analysis is to ensure **reflexive continuity** — so the system can correct itself *before* it risks collapse.
