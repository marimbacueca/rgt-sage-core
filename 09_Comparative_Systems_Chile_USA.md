## Reflexive Parameters by Regime (Illustrative)
| Country | Policy Lattice (Annex A) | VI Setup (Annex B) | Γ Target | Cone α | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| USA | Rights lattice (federal/state) | Market-regulatory VI | ρ(Γ)<0.9 | 0.5 | High interagency coupling; enforce dwell-time. |
| Chile | Municipal rights tiers | Resource allocation VI | ρ(Γ)<0.85 | 0.5 | Strong municipal variability; prioritize HF. |

*Calibrate with local data; keep SR^r and Safe policies active.*
