# Security Policy — RGT Sage Core (v2.0)

Although this repository does not contain executable code, it defines a **governance architecture** whose misuse, distortion, or misinterpretation could have real-world consequences.

This security policy establishes how to report vulnerabilities, misalignments, or conceptual risks.

---

## 🔐 Scope of Security Concerns

### This repository treats “security” as:
- protection of *interpretive safety*,  
- maintaining *symbolic and conceptual integrity*,  
- preventing *misuse of architectural models*,  
- ensuring *reversibility*,  
- avoiding *irreversible harm through misunderstanding*,  
- and maintaining *the ethical boundaries of RGT*.

### Risks include:
- misinterpretation that leads to harmful governance applications,  
- incorrect use of α/K that results in unstable control systems,  
- misuse of phenomenological data,  
- symbolic extraction or identity harm,  
- ignoring safety constraints or drift signals,  
- unauthorized derivative frameworks misrepresenting RGT.

## 🛡 Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find:

- conceptual inconsistencies  
- mathematical errors  
- ethical violations  
- incorrect drift mappings  
- misalignments between files  
- symbolic contradictions  
- risks of irreversible harm  
- or ambiguity that could be exploited  

please report it.

### How to report:
Open a GitHub issue with the tag:

[security]

yaml
Copy code

Include:

1. the file name,  
2. the section in question,  
3. a description of the vulnerability,  
4. the potential impact,  
5. your recommended correction (optional).

For sensitive issues, email the maintainers directly.

## 🧭 Security Principles for RGT v2.0

All files must adhere to:

### **1. Safety Envelope (v2.0)**  
- ε-boundary < 0.6  
- SCI ≥ 0.65  
- MLI ≤ 0.7  
- reversibility requirements (R0–R2)  
- symbolic and narrative integrity  

### **2. Stability Envelope (α/K)**  
Contributions must not introduce α/K imbalances.

### **3. Reflexive Data Loops**  
All loops must remain contractive (G < 1).  
Loop integrity is a core security guarantee.

### **4. Interpretive Safety**  
No extraction of personal meaning.  
No collapse of Presence ↔ Articulation boundaries.

### **5. Provenance & Integrity**  
All additions must include rationale, provenance, and justification.

## 🔄 Responsible Disclosure

Please allow maintainers reasonable time to review and correct vulnerabilities before public discussion.

Security issues that impact conceptual safety, real-world governance use, or human–AI partnership ethics receive priority.

## 🔐 Final Notes

Because RGT is a governance architecture, not executable code:

**Security = Stability + Ethics + Correct Interpretation.**

Protecting the architecture protects the systems that may one day implement it.
