# Information Resilience Framework (v2.0)

Information resilience is the ability of a governed system to **maintain integrity, coherence, and interpretive capacity** across disturbances, noise, distortions, load, and conflict.

It belongs primarily to **L0 (Data & Provenance)** and **L1 (Indices & Drift)**, but its failure destabilizes **all layers** including:

- **L2** (control and α/K tuning)  
- **L3** (governance, legitimacy, votation)  
- **L4** (Sage agent interpretation)  

This v2.0 version integrates the full **Safety Envelope**, **Reflexive Data Loops**, and the **Reflexive Stability Envelope**.

---

# 1. Purpose of Information Resilience

Information resilience is required for:

1. **Accurate perception** of the system and its environment  
2. **Stable reasoning** under uncertainty  
3. **Fair and legitimate governance**  
4. **Protection against drift and social fragmentation**  
5. **Preservation of meaning coherence and symbolic clarity**  

A system that cannot perceive itself cannot govern itself.

---

# 2. Core Principles

### **2.1 Provenance Before Interpretation**
All interpretations must have:

- source transparency,  
- transformation transparency,  
- uncertainty visibility.

If provenance is weak → **α must increase**, **K must decrease**, and governance should shift to **Presence Mode**.

---

### **2.2 Early Drift Detection**
Information systems must detect:

- structural drift,  
- normative drift,  
- legitimacy drift,  
- symbolic drift,  
- metabolic drift (system overload).

Weak drift detection = unstable governance.

This is governed by **RDL-1 (Drift Sentry Loop)**.

---

### **2.3 Noise-Resilient Coherence**
The system must preserve **coherence** (alignment of meaning, signals, and decisions) even under:

- conflicting narratives,  
- low-quality signals,  
- symbolic fragmentation.

Coherence is not unanimity — it is **directional stability**.

---

### **2.4 Meaning as Information**
Narratives, symbols, rituals, and aesthetic forms are *informational assets*.  
Their degradation is an information-resilience failure.

Meaning collapse is treated as drift.

---

# 3. Information Resilience Components

## **3.1 Provenance Integrity**
L0 requires that all signals include:

- source identity,  
- method of capture,  
- potential sources of bias,  
- uncertainty class,  
- transformation history.

If any element is missing, the signal is **downgraded** and flagged.

---

## **3.2 Signal Quality Index (SQI)**
A composite measure combining:

- resolution (granularity),  
- noise level,  
- timeliness,  
- contextual fit,  
- vulnerability to manipulation.

SQI feeds into **L1 indices** and adjusts **α** automatically (via **RDL-3**).

---

## **3.3 Legitimacy & Fairness Signals**
Fairness and legitimacy indicators must be tracked as first-class signals:

- fairness index \( F_t \)  
- legitimacy index \( L_t \)  
- participation parity \( p_t \)  
- meaning coherence \( C_t \)

They influence **α/K stability**, governance intensity, and drift detection.

---

## **3.4 Symbolic / Narrative Signals**
The symbolic field generates signals via:

- imagery coherence,  
- narrative consistency,  
- ritual alignment,  
- emotional climate.

Weak symbolic signals = **symbolic drift** = governance risk.

---

# 4. Information Threat Model (v2.0)

The threat model includes:

## **4.1 Distortion Risks**
- **Noise inflation** (randomness presented as signal)  
- **Bias smuggling** (strategic narrative pollution)  
- **Context slip** (partial context overlap)  
- **Imitative governance** (copying logic from unrelated domains)

---

## **4.2 Breakdown Risks**
- coherence decay  
- provenance opacity  
- communication overload  
- symbolic contradiction  
- metabolic overload (too many high-intensity decisions)

---

## **4.3 Manipulation Risks**
- fairness masking  
- meaning dilution  
- synthetic consensus (false appearance of alignment)  
- performance-over-legitimacy misdirection  

---

## **4.4 Safety Envelope Risks**
- ε-boundary pressure  
- high contextual overlap  
- ethical uncertainty  
- irreversibility without adequate modeling  
- α/K ethical curve violations  

---

# 5. Stability Conditions

Information resilience contributes to stability through:

### **5.1 Contractive Information Processing**
Information loops must remain contractive or small-gain stable.

If noise or load exceeds thresholds → system risks instability.

### **5.2 α/K Envelope Compliance**
Information integrity determines admissible regions for:

- sensitivity (α)  
- intensity (K)

Poor information → tighten envelope.

### **5.3 Reversibility Awareness**
Irreversible decisions require:

- high information certainty,  
- high meaning coherence,  
- complete provenance,  
- low drift.

If any conditions fail → decision must be paused or simulated (RDL-4).

---

# 6. Safety Envelope v2.0 Integration

Information resilience is enforced by:

### **6.1 Epsilon-Boundary (ε) Protections**
Crossing ε via misinformation or symbolic collapse is treated as a critical failure.

### **6.2 Context Overlap Detection**
Information misuse from one domain to another (e.g., militarized logic in welfare governance) is flagged at L1.

### **6.3 Metabolic Overload Flags**
Signal flow and interpretation load contribute to metabolic exhaustion.

Overload → drift → instability.

### **6.4 Ethical Uncertainty Markers**
Missing or ambiguous information → raise α, lower K, engage RDL-3.

---

# 7. Reflexive Data Loop (RDL) Integration

Information resilience connects to RDLs as follows:

- **RDL-1 — Drift Sentry**: detects informational drift.  
- **RDL-2 — Gain Scheduling**: reduces K under noisy signals.  
- **RDL-3 — Cadence Control**: increases α under uncertainty.  
- **RDL-4 — Off-Policy Evaluation**: tests decisions against informational quality.  
- **RDL-5 — Multi-Objective Balancing**: weighs signals against tradeoffs.  
- **RDL-6 — Canary / Ethics Gate**: tests high-risk signals in small domains.  
- **RDL-7 — Provenance & Reversibility**: evaluates informational reversibility.  
- **RDL-8 — Metabolic Cadence**: monitors information volume vs load.

---

# 8. Information Resilience Protocols (IRP v2.0)

### **IRP-1: Provenance Check**
Always confirm:
- source,  
- uncertainty,  
- bias class,  
- missingness,  
- transformation chain.

### **IRP-2: Drift Status Check**
Evaluate:
- fairness drift,  
- legitimacy drift,  
- symbolic drift,  
- metabolic drift.

### **IRP-3: Envelope Check**
Determine:
- α/K posture,  
- ethical uncertainty,  
- ε-pressure,  
- context overlap.

### **IRP-4: Reversibility Check**
Flag irreversible actions under poor information conditions.

### **IRP-5: Metabolic Load Assessment**
Identify:
- overload,  
- compression,  
- urgency distortion.

### **IRP-6: Story / Symbol Inspection**
Audit narrative and aesthetic coherence.

---

# 9. Minimum Standards (v2.0+)

- Complete provenance required for all high-impact decisions  
- Fairness + legitimacy indices cannot be ignored  
- Symbolic field must be coherent  
- No irreversible decisions under low-coherence states  
- Mode-sensitive governance enforced by information quality  
- Communication must not exceed metabolic safety limits  
- ε-boundary proximity triggers conservative posture  

---

# 10. Summary

Information resilience is not a technical matter — it is:

- symbolic,  
- cognitive,  
- ethical,  
- operational,  
- and political.  

In RGT v2.0, information integrity is the **single most important determinant of stability**.  
If information fails, the system cannot perceive drift, cannot tune α/K safely, cannot govern legitimately, and cannot maintain meaning coherence.

It is the foundation of **Reflexive Governance**.
