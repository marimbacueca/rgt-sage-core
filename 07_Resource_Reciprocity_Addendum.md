## Ethics Gate Alignment (v1.0)
All reciprocity policies MUST pass vector EG gate with cone C(α): HF ≥ α‖others‖ (α default 0.5).  
Use projection Π_C(EG_vec) before resource allocation to guarantee Pareto-safe moves.

## Stability & Reciprocity
If Γ spikes (interdependence surge), throttle η and lengthen dwell time T_d per Annex J §J.9 to preserve V_tot descent.
