# RGT Sage — Reflexive Governance Theory Core (v1.0)
[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.17503827.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17503827)

**Purpose.**  
RGT Sage v1.0 marks the **completion of the Reflexive Mathematics Core** — a closed, empirically validated set of theorems uniting logic, ethics, stability, strategy, and thermodynamics under one reflexive framework.

**Signature Narrative.**  
Governance as equilibrium between awareness and correction.  
Mathematics as proof that reflexivity can learn faster than collapse.

**Integrity.**  
This file’s SHA-256 hash verifies corpus integrity (see header).  
For reproducibility, all numerical seeds and invariants are listed in §28 of the corpus.

**Root File:** `RGT_Sage_Operating_Instructions_v1.1.md`

## Reflexive Mathematics Core (Annexes E–M)

| Layer | Annex | Core Result |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| Logic | E + L | Reflexive Consistency & Safe-bounded Incompleteness |
| Dynamics | F + J | Global Equilibrium · Meta-Stability · Small-Gain · Delay Tolerance |
| Ethics | G | Vector-Cone Lyapunov Descent · HF-Dominance |
| Strategy | K | Reflexive Game Theory · Extragradient Convergence |
| Thermodynamics | M | Reflexive Entropy · Irreversible Arrow of Time |

Each theorem is both **analytically proved** and **empirically verified** through §28’s mini-simulations:  
cone-gating, small-gain stability, VI convergence, and entropy monotonicity.

## Empirical Verification (§28 — Simulation Suite)

Four deterministic simulations validate the mathematical invariants:

| Simulation | Property Verified | Key Invariant |
|-------------|------------------|----------------|
| Vector EG Cone (Annex G) | Ethics projection | HF ≥ α‖others‖ |
| Small-Gain Stability (Annex J) | Meta-stability | ρ(Γ) < 1 |
| Reflexive Game (Annex K) | Equilibrium convergence | τ < μ ⁄ L² |
| Reflexive Entropy (Annex M) | Irreversibility | ΔH_R ≥ 0 |

All plots and JSON summaries are reproducible via:

```bash
python RGT_SimSuite.py --all
```

---

## Toolchain (New in v1.0)

| Tool | Function |
|------|-----------|
| **RGT_SimSuite.py** | Generates the four Annex simulations and produces JSON summaries. |
| **Reflexive_Metrics_Validator.py** | Validates invariants (ΔV_R ≤ 0, ρ(Γ) < 1, H_R↑, τ < μ/L², cone feasibility). |
| **workflows/release.yml** | Automated GitHub release + SHA-256 artifact upload. |
| **workflows/validate.yml** | CI for reproducibility — runs sims and checks invariants. |
| **workflows/lint.yml** | Enforces clean, reproducible code style (Ruff + Black). |

---

## Operational Invariants

ΔV_R ≤ 0 (Lyapunov descent)  
ρ(Γ) < 1 (stability)  
τ < μ / L² (solver safety)  
H_R(t+1) ≥ H_R(t) (arrow of time)  
HF − α‖others‖ ≥ 0 (ethical feasibility)

These invariants define the reflexive boundary of stability and learning.

## Epilogue (§49)

> **When systems learn to breathe, governance becomes awareness in motion.**  
>  
> Reflexive Mathematics Core v1.0 closes the circle of proof and presence:  
> what was intuition is now theorem, and what was theorem is now testable.

## Change Log

- **v1.0 (2025-11-01)** — Mathematical Core finalized (Annexes E–M), Simulation Suite (§28),  
  Mathematical Calibration Report (§51), tools + workflows added.  
- **v3.6.1 → v1.0 bridge** — Transition from *Signature Edition* narrative corpus to  
  empirical and mathematical closure.
