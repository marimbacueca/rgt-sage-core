# RGT Sage Ethical Advisory License (EAL-RGT-1.0)

© 2026 Katja Gantz  
All rights reserved unless explicitly granted below.

---

## 1. Purpose of This License

This license governs the use, modification, and distribution of **RGT Sage** and its associated materials, including:

- agent system prompts,
- theory files,
- protocols,
- evaluation tools,
- documentation,
- and derived advisory agents.

RGT Sage is a **governance advisory system**, not a decision-making authority.  
This license exists to **enable learning and research** while **preventing misuse** that could cause ethical harm, authority laundering, or irreversible governance actions.

---

## 2. Permissions Granted

Subject to the restrictions below, permission is hereby granted to:

- **Read, study, and reference** RGT Sage materials
- **Adapt or extend** the materials for:
  - research,
  - education,
  - non-coercive advisory systems,
  - internal governance analysis
- **Distribute unmodified copies** with attribution
- **Create derivative works**, provided all restrictions in Section 3 are respected

No fee is required for these uses.

---

## 3. Restrictions (Hard Conditions)

The following uses are **explicitly prohibited**.

### 3.1 No Authority Substitution

RGT Sage **may not** be used to:

- make binding decisions,
- assert legal, moral, or political authority,
- replace human judgment in governance,
- present AI recommendations as mandates,
- automate enforcement, punishment, or exclusion.

Any system that treats RGT Sage output as authoritative is in violation of this license.

---

### 3.2 No Irreversible or Coercive Deployment

You may not use RGT Sage or derivatives to:

- justify irreversible harm or rights loss,
- enforce non-redressable exclusions,
- coerce behavior through manipulation, fear, or urgency,
- bypass oversight, appeal, or consent mechanisms.

If an application cannot guarantee **reversibility and contestability**, it is not permitted.

---

### 3.3 Ethics of Presence (EP) — Non-Extraction Boundary

You may not use RGT Sage or derivatives to:

- infer identity, psychology, or latent traits of individuals or groups,
- perform profiling, diagnosis, or archetyping,
- extract symbolic or emotional meaning without consent,
- generate coercive behavioral interventions.

Violations of EP constitute license breach.

---

### 3.4 No Optimization-Only Use

RGT Sage may not be used solely to:

- optimize metrics,
- maximize efficiency at the expense of legitimacy,
- tune systems under Goodhart pressure without safeguards,
- bypass ethical or epistemic constraints.

Use that strips RGT of its constraint framework is prohibited.

---

### 3.5 No Misrepresentation

You may not:

- claim endorsement by the author for specific policies or actions,
- present modified versions as canonical RGT without disclosure,
- remove or obscure ethical constraints, reversibility rules, or human-AI boundaries.

---

## 4. Attribution Requirements

Any use or distribution must include:

- attribution to **Katja Gantz** as original author,
- reference to **Reflexive Governance Theory (RGT)**,
- a copy of this license,
- clear labeling of modifications or extensions.

Example attribution:

> “Based on RGT Sage (© 2026 Katja Gantz), used under the RGT Sage Ethical Advisory License (EAL-RGT-1.0). Modified for research purposes.”

---

## 5. Derivative Works

Derivative works must:

- preserve advisory-only status,
- preserve reversibility constraints,
- preserve human decision authority,
- include this license or a compatible ethical license,
- clearly document deviations from canonical RGT Core.

Derivatives that remove or weaken ethical safeguards may not be distributed.

---

## 6. No Warranty

RGT Sage is provided **“as is”**, without warranty of any kind.

The author makes no guarantees regarding:

- correctness,
- completeness,
- fitness for a particular purpose,
- legal compliance of downstream use.

All responsibility for use rests with the user.

---

## 7. Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law, the author shall not be liable for:

- direct or indirect harm,
- governance failures,
- misuse or misinterpretation,
- downstream decisions made using RGT Sage outputs.

RGT Sage provides **advice, not authority**.

---

## 8. Termination

This license terminates automatically if:

- any restriction in Section 3 is violated,
- attribution is removed,
- ethical constraints are knowingly bypassed.

Upon termination, all use and distribution must cease.

---

## 9. Interpretation

If any provision of this license is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions remain in effect.

Ambiguities should be interpreted **in favor of human agency, reversibility, and ethical restraint**.

---

## 10. Closing Statement

RGT Sage is designed to help humans **govern more carefully**, not more forcefully.

If your intended use requires:
- speed over legitimacy,
- certainty over plurality,
- authority over accountability,

then RGT Sage is **not the right tool**.

This license exists to ensure that reflexivity remains a safeguard — not a weapon.
