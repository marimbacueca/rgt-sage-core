# NOTICE — RGT Sage

© 2026 Katja Gantz  
Reflexive Governance Theory (RGT) and RGT Sage

---

## 1. What This Project Is

**RGT Sage** is an advisory reasoning system based on **Reflexive Governance Theory (RGT)**.

It is designed to help humans:
- reason about governance under uncertainty,
- detect drift, capture, and legitimacy risk,
- maintain reversibility, ethical restraint, and plural interpretation,
- stress-test decisions before harm occurs.

RGT Sage is **not** a decision engine, authority, regulator, or enforcement system.

---

## 2. What This Project Is Not

RGT Sage does **not**:

- make binding decisions,
- assert legal, moral, or political authority,
- replace human judgment,
- certify compliance, safety, or correctness,
- justify irreversible actions,
- optimize outcomes at the expense of legitimacy or dignity.

Any use that treats RGT Sage output as authoritative is a misuse.

## 4. License Reference

This project is licensed under the:

**RGT Sage Ethical Advisory License (EAL-RGT-1.0)**

Key implications:
- advisory-only use,

---

## 5. Ethical Boundary Notice (Critical)

RGT Sage enforces a strict **Ethics of Presence (EP)** boundary.

Downstream users must not use this project to:
- infer identity, psychology, or latent traits,
- profile or categorize persons or groups,
- manipulate behavior coercively,
- bypass consent, oversight, or appeal,
- launder authority through AI-generated coherence.

Violations are both an ethical breach and a license violation.

---

## 6. Advisory Nature Disclaimer

Outputs generated by RGT Sage:
- are **contextual and conditional**,
- depend on input quality and framing,
- require human interpretation and judgment,
- must remain reversible and reviewable.

They do **not** constitute:
- professional advice,
- legal determinations,
- policy mandates,
- ethical verdicts.

---

## 7. Modifications & Derivatives

If you modify, extend, or adapt RGT Sage:

- clearly mark your changes,
- do not present derivatives as canonical RGT without disclosure,
- preserve ethical guardrails and human-AI boundaries,
- retain this NOTICE or an equivalent attribution notice.

Removing or weakening safeguards must be explicitly disclosed.

---

## 8. Third-Party Content

Unless otherwise stated:
- no third-party code is included,
- no external frameworks are embedded as dependencies,
- references are conceptual, not incorporative.

If third-party materials are added downstream, their notices must be included separately.

---

## 9. Interpretation Guidance

If there is ambiguity about acceptable use, interpret this NOTICE in favor of:

- human agency over automation,
- legitimacy over efficiency,
- reversibility over force,
- plurality over coerced consensus,
- restraint over optimization.

---

## 10. Closing Statement

RGT Sage exists to help governance **slow down before it breaks things**.

If your use case requires:
- speed without consent,
- certainty without humility,
- authority without accountability,

then this project is **not intended for that purpose**.

This NOTICE is part of the system’s ethical infrastructure.
