# Contributing to RGT Sage Core

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **Reflexive Governance Theory (RGT) — Sage Core**.  
This repository contains the formal system architecture, ethical scaffolding, stability math, and pilot specifications for RGT v2.0.

Because the repository reflects a **research-grade governance specification**, contributions must follow clear standards of stability, reversibility, provenance, and conceptual coherence.

## 📐 Contribution Principles

All contributions must:

1. **Preserve Reflexive Integrity**  
   - Maintain compatibility with the RGT System Architecture (v0.2).  
   - Ensure all additions obey Layer (L0–L4) boundaries.  
   - Follow α/K Stability Envelope principles.

2. **Respect the Safety Envelope (v2.0)**  
   Contributions must not introduce:  
   - irreversibility without simulation,  
   - symbolic contradictions,  
   - fairness or legitimacy drift,  
   - metabolic overload,  
   - cross-domain contamination.

3. **Maintain Non-Extractive Interpretive Ethics**  
   - No unjustified certainty claims.  
   - No overstepping into personal meaning extraction.  
   - Ensure reversibility and contextual framing.

4. **Use Proper Versioning**  
   - Version numbers exist only inside YAML headers.  
   - Do *not* include version suffixes in filenames.  
   - Follow semantic versioning for file editions.

5. **Preserve Stability & Mathematical Validity**  
   - All Reflexive Data Loops must remain contractive (G < 1).  
   - Changes affecting indices, α/K, or envelopes must include rationale.

## 🧭 Process for Making Contributions

### 1. Fork & Branch
- Fork the repository.  
- Create a branch named:  
feature/<topic> or fix/<topic>

markdown
Copy code

### 2. Make Your Changes
- Ensure all files updated include revised YAML headers.  
- Update **File 01** (Learning Log) if the change introduces new insight.  
- Update **File 02** (Chronology) if it alters intellectual structure.  
- Update **File 17** (Crosslinks Index) if file roles change.

### 3. Submit a Pull Request
Your PR must include:

- **Purpose**  
- **Which files were changed**  
- **Impact on the architecture**  
- **If applicable, changes to drift, α/K, or metrics**  
- **Safety Envelope alignment statement**

### 4. Review Phase
Review criteria:
- structural coherence  
- symbolic coherence  
- mathematical validity  
- ethical compliance  
- reversibility  
- precision of language  
- integration with RDLs  

PRs impacting core theory undergo extended review.

## 🧪 Testing & Validation Requirements

Because this is a research specification:

- No code compilation required.  
- **Conceptual consistency checks** *are required*.  
- Contributors must verify:  
- drift indices remain intact,  
- no envelope violations are introduced,  
- symbolic fields remain coherent,  
- mathematical statements remain correct,  
- pilot modules remain aligned.
