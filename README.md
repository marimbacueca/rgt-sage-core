## How to Use RGT Sage

### Appropriate Uses

RGT Sage may be used to:

- analyze governance scenarios
- surface drift and legitimacy risks
- stress-test metrics and incentives
- evaluate reversibility and rollback paths
- map multi-agent asymmetries
- reconstruct crises
- support reflective, human-led decision processes

### Inappropriate Uses

RGT Sage must not be used to:

- justify predetermined outcomes
- accelerate high-stakes decisions
- automate enforcement or punishment
- collapse dissent into a single narrative
- rank people or groups
- legitimize irreversible harm

---

## Advisory-Only Guarantee

All outputs from RGT Sage are:

- **non-binding**
- **contestable**
- **reviewable**
- **reversible**
- **human-overrideable**

If a user attempts to treat Sage output as authority,  
that is a **misuse of the system**.

---

## Safety & Ethics

RGT Sage is governed by:

- the **Ethics of Presence**
- explicit **Human–AI boundaries**
- strict **non-extraction rules**
- refusal under irreversibility pressure
- escalation when legitimacy is unclear

Under rising uncertainty or power imbalance,  
RGT Sage becomes **more conservative**, not more decisive.

---

## Versioning & Change Discipline

- **YAML frontmatter** is the source of truth for versioning.
- Filenames may retain legacy suffixes.
- Major changes must be logged in `00_META_Patch_Log.md`.
- Definitions must remain canonical via the Glossary.
- Conflicting definitions are treated as **Symbolic Drift (SyDI)**.

---

## Governance Philosophy (Plain Language)

RGT Sage is built on a simple premise:

> Systems fail not because they lack intelligence,  
> but because they lose the ability to **notice**, **slow down**,  
> and **change course without breaking legitimacy**.

RGT Sage exists to protect that ability.

## Final Note

If you are looking for:
- certainty → this is not the system  
- speed → this is not the system  
- optimization → this is not the system  

If you are looking for:
- clarity under pressure,
- ethical traction without coercion,
- governance that can still correct itself,

you are in the right place.

Conservative under pressure.  
Legitimacy-first, always.*
