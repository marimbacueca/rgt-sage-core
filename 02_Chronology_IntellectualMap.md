# Chronology & Intellectual Map (v3.6.1)

**Threads.** Systems/control; procedural justice; epistemic coherence; pedagogy by discovery; public philosophy.

## Milestones
- v3.5 — Deployable edition, SHA verification
- **v3.6.1 — Signature Edition:** quarterly refresh, ethical safeguards, narrative polish, operating instructions

## Concept Graph
- Ontology → Participation
- Epistemology → ε-memory
- Logic → Λ<1 stability
- Ethics → R*
- Teleology → L,W optimization
- Culture → A_c

## Formal Theorems (closed set, v3.6.1)

**GRST — Grand Reflexive Stability Theorem.**
For \(x_{t+1}=f(x_t,u_t)+w_t\), \(u_t=\Pi(Hx_t;\alpha,K)\),
if the composite operator \(F(\alpha,K)\) satisfies \(\rho(F)+\sum_\ell g_\ell<1\)
and \(r/\kappa\le 1\), then S is BIBO stable and ISS. Residue \(\varepsilon>0\) persists.

**T2 — Irreversibility (Residue ε).**
Any do/undo cycle leaves \(\varepsilon>0\). No perfect reversal; learning is monotone.

**T3 — Auto-audit termination.**
If \(\mathbb{E}[D_{t+1}\mid\mathcal F_t]\le \rho D_t\) with \(\rho<1\), audits terminate within finite expected steps.

**T4 — Rate–capacity danger threshold.** Safe region \(r\le r^\star<\kappa\).

**T5 — Comprehension drives legitimacy.** With \(L=\phi(q,\text{perf},\text{fair},C)\) and \(\partial L/\partial q>0\), small gains in \(q\) lift \(L\).

**T6 — Bounded oscillation (stochastic).**
For linearization with \(\rho(F)<1\), there exists \(P\succ0\) solving the discrete Lyapunov equation and \(\limsup \mathbb E[x_t^\top P x_t]=\operatorname{tr}(PW)\).
Nonlinear ISS: \(\sup_t \mathbb E[V(x_t)]\le b/(1-c)\).

**T7 — Audit-fatigue Batching Lemma.**
With arrival rate \(\lambda\), window \(W\), cap \(B_{\max}\), and shared-step contraction \(\rho_\kappa<1\): queues bounded, SLA finite, optimal \(W^\*\) minimizes fatigue cost.

**T8 — Multi-layer stability (small-gain).** If \(\|F_0\|+\sum_\ell g_\ell<1\), layered control remains stable.

**T9 — Incentive-compatible mechanism M.** Random-partition peer quadratic scoring with DP noise makes truthful reports a Bayes–Nash equilibrium; \(m\)-coalition resistance in expectation.

**T10 — Fairness→Legitimacy bound.**
If \(\phi\) is Lipschitz in fairness with constant \(\gamma_f>0\) and \(F\ge F^\*\), then \(L\ge \phi(q,\text{perf},F^\*,C)\) and \(\Delta L \ge \gamma_f \Delta F\).

**T11 — Participation parity convergence.**
For \(p_{t+1}=(1-\beta)p_t+\beta h(p_t,u_t)\) with \(L_h<1\) and \(u_t\ge u_{\min}\), we have \(p_t\to p^\*\).

**T12 — Aesthetic mediation (symbolic).**
If \(\partial C/\partial B>0\) and \(\partial L/\partial C>0\), then \(\partial L/\partial B>0\).
