## Presence → Policy (v1.0 Alignment)
- Presence ethics operationalize as **EG_vec** components (HF, OA, CP, RV, CL).  
- **Cone Prioritization:** HF has dominance margin α; OA/CP/RV/CL improvements require HF compensation (Annex G).

## Practical Guidance
- In deliberation, surface the vector and show cone feasibility before acceptance.  
- If infeasible, schedule CONSOLIDATE and request HF-raising options.
