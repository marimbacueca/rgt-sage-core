# RGT Sage — Operating Instructions (v2.0)

These instructions define how to **read**, **use**, **update**, and **navigate** the RGT Sage Core repository.  
This file is the master reference for interaction rules, safety conditions, and file relationships.

---

# 1. Purpose of This Repository

RGT Sage Core contains:

- the formal architecture of Reflexive Governance Theory (v0.2),  
- operational modules for drift detection and correction,  
- ethical and phenomenological boundaries,  
- mathematical foundations,  
- pilot specifications,  
- and the documentation required for future computational implementations.

It is not a codebase.  
It is a **governance architecture**.

---

# 2. How to Read the Repository

The repository is organized into **17 numbered files**, each representing a conceptual role.

### The reading order:

1. **03 — Glossary**  
2. **06 — Metrics Appendix**  
3. **04 — Crisis Protocol**  
4. **08 — Information Resilience Framework**  
5. **07 — Reciprocity**  
6. **05 — Gap Analysis**  
7. **09–13** Specialized Modules  
8. **14–16** Pilot Modules  
9. **17 — Crosslinks Index**  
10. **01–02** META files for context (optional)  

Use the numbering system to understand the *conceptual sequence*, not chronology.

---

# 3. Safety Requirements for Reading & Using RGT

Every module obeys the **Safety Envelope (v2.0):**

- ε-boundary < 0.6  
- SCI ≥ 0.65  
- MLI ≤ 0.7  
- R0–R2 reversibility classification  
- context isolation (no cross-contamination)  
- non-extractive interpretive boundaries  
- phenom data treated as reversible and contextual  

Users must understand:  
**RGT is a stability-first theory.  
Misapplication outside constraints may cause harm.**

---

# 4. Interpretation Model

RGT uses a dual-mode cognition:

### **Presence Mode**  
- sensing  
- ambiguity  
- phenomenology  
- symbolic context  
- drift detection  

### **Articulation Mode**  
- structure  
- precision  
- decisions  
- metrics  
- explanation  

Switching modes incorrectly introduces risk.  
Interpretation must remain grounded in **Presence Mode**,  
while execution must occur in **Articulation Mode**.

---

# 5. Updating the Repository

Any update must follow:

### **1. Architectural Alignment**
Must preserve:
- L0–L4 boundaries  
- α/K Stability Envelope  
- Drift Indices  
- Safety Envelope v2.0  
- RDL contractiveness  
- symbolic coherence  

### **2. Document Updates**
When updating content:

- Update **File 01** (Learning Log)  
- Update **File 02** (Chronology)  
- Update **File 17** (Crosslinks Index)  
- Ensure YAML headers are correct  
- Maintain file-number roles  

### **3. Versioning**
File versions live **inside YAML**, not filenames.

---

# 6. Conventions

### **Language**
- precise  
- reversible  
- non-extractive  
- symbolically coherent  
- stable across interpretations  

### **Mathematical Expressions**
Follow consistency with:
- small-gain condition  
- α/K envelope  
- drift acceleration  
- fairness–legitimacy coupling  

---

# 7. Interaction with AI Systems

RGT is designed for eventual computational implementation.  
AI systems using this repository must:

- obey the Safety Envelope  
- maintain non-extractive interpretation  
- avoid symbolic flattening  
- perform only reversible analysis  
- use RDLs for calibration  
- respect α/K boundaries  

Humans remain the **ultimate decision-makers**.

---

# 8. Summary

These operating instructions define how to:

- navigate the theory,  
- interpret its modules,  
- maintain its integrity,  
- expand it safely,  
- and prepare it for future computational life.

RGT Sage Core is a living architecture.  
Its stability depends on **reflexive updating**, careful interpretation, and respect for the system’s ethical and mathematical boundaries.
