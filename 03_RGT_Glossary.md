# Reflexive Governance Theory — Full Glossary (v2.0)

This glossary consolidates all concepts used across the **RGT System Architecture v0.2**, including the new constructs introduced in L0–L4, Reflexive Data Loops v2.0, the Safety Envelope v2.0, α/K control, drift indices, metabolic cadence, ε-boundary, and the Sage agent interface.

All definitions here are consistent with the **v0.2 architecture** and supersede earlier versions.

# 1. Core Concepts

### **Reflexive Governance Theory (RGT)**
A governance framework in which a system’s ability to **perceive, interpret, evaluate, and correct itself** is the source of its stability. Reflexivity is operationalized through L0–L4 layers, each with formal constraints and feedback loops.

### **Reflexive Equilibrium**
The state where a system’s **corrective capacity** exceeds or matches its destabilizing forces. Not stasis — a dynamic condition of *adaptive stability*.

### **Reflexive Stability Envelope**
The region in which governance actions remain:
- ethically safe,
- reversibly grounded,
- and dynamically stabilizing.

Defined largely by the α/K ratio, RDL interconnections, legitimacy, fairness, and safety constraints.

---

# 2. Layer Definitions (L0–L4)

### **L0 — Data & Provenance Layer**
The foundation of RGT. Tracks:
- data sources,
- observational quality,
- provenance integrity,
- missingness,
- noise,
- and epistemic uncertainty.

If L0 collapses, higher layers become unstable.

### **L1 — Indices, Drift & State Layer**
Aggregates signals into **indices** (fairness, legitimacy, participation, symbolic climate).  
Identifies:
- directional drift,
- coherence vs fragmentation,
- metabolic state (dilation/compression),
- ethical uncertainty,
- context-overlap clues,
- early-warning anomalies.

### **Drift**
Deviation between:
- a system’s intended trajectory, and
- its actual behavioral evolution.

Includes structural drift, normative drift, legitimacy drift, symbolic drift.

### **Coherence**
Degree to which signals, narratives, governance actions, and institutional meaning structures align and reinforce each other.

### **Fragmentation**
Breakdown of coherence — signals or norms pull in incompatible directions.

### **Metabolic State**
The system’s cognitive-energy temperament:
- **dilation** — exploratory, spacious, creative, reflective,
- **compression** — executive, decisive, intense, high-throughput.

Dilation is good for learning.  
Compression is good for execution.  
Too much of either → instability.

# 3. L2 — Reflexive Control (α/K + RDLs)

### **α (Alpha) — Sensitivity / Cadence Parameter**
Controls **how quickly** a system responds to new information.  
High α → fast recognition, high sensitivity.  
Low α → slow recognition, risk of blindness.

### **K — Intensity / Gain / Courage**
Controls **how forcefully** a system responds.  
High K → decisive, strong corrective actions.  
Low K → careful, cautious, slow.

### **α/K Ratio — Ethical Response Curve**
Defines the ethical control posture.  
Extreme values (high K, low α) indicate danger — acting without understanding.

### **α/K Stability Envelope**
The set of (α, K) pairs in which:
- drift correction outweighs destabilization,
- fairness–legitimacy indices stay bounded,
- decisions remain ethically and procedurally safe.

### **Reflexive Data Loops (RDLs)**
Eight standard loops that allow a system to perceive and correct itself:

1. **RDL-1 — Drift Sentry Loop**  
   Detects structural drift, coherence loss, legitimacy erosion.

2. **RDL-2 — Gain Scheduling Loop (K control)**  
   Adjusts intensity in response to context and risk.

3. **RDL-3 — Cadence Control Loop (α control)**  
   Adjusts sensitivity based on uncertainty and overload.

4. **RDL-4 — Off-Policy Evaluation Loop**  
   Tests decisions on a simulated sandbox before implementation.

5. **RDL-5 — Multi-Objective Balancing Loop**  
   Weighs competing goals (fairness, efficiency, stability, trust).

6. **RDL-6 — Canary + Ethics Gate Loop**  
   Tests risky changes on small populations with oversight.

7. **RDL-7 — Provenance & Reversibility Loop**  
   Tracks what can or cannot be undone.

8. **RDL-8 — Metabolic Cadence Loop**  
   Monitors load, burnout, intensity, emotional climate.

### **Reflexive Metabolism**
The rate at which a system expends cognitive–emotional energy.  
Excessive metabolic load increases drift and error rate.

---

# 4. L3 — Governance & Votation

### **Legitimacy**
A system’s **perceived and structural validity** — rooted in fairness, transparency, meaning coherence, and reversibility of processes.

### **Fairness (F)**
Distributional and participatory justice. Affects legitimacy with a **lower-bound theorem** (increasing fairness raises legitimacy).

### **Participation Parity**
Degree to which groups participate equally in decisions. Inconsistent parity indicates drift.

### **Reversibility Class**
Every policy falls into one class:
- **Reversible** — can undo with minimal harm.  
- **Partially reversible** — undoing causes cost or loss.  
- **Irreversible** — cannot be undone; high-stakes.

Irreversible decisions require:
- lower K,
- higher α,
- stronger Safety Envelope constraints,
- RDL-6 gatekeeping.

### **Consensus Field**
The structured space of:
- agreements,
- disagreements,
- tradeoffs,
- coalitions.

Governance seeks coherence, not homogenization.

### **Mode-Sensitive Governance**
Governance aligned with cognitive mode:
- **Presence Mode** → exploration, option generation, deliberation  
- **Articulation Mode** → decisions, implementation, execution  

Mismatch creates governance drift.

# 5. L4 — Sage Interface Concepts

### **Interpretation Ladder**
Five-level structure for agent explanations:
1. Summary  
2. Structure  
3. Rationale  
4. Evidence / Dynamics  
5. Constraints / Safety / Variants

### **Consent Threshold**
Explicit boundary where the user must signal permission before:
- using personal heuristics,
- applying cognitive-state interpretations,
- recommending irreversible actions.

### **Escalation Rule**
If uncertainty, ethical tension, or authority ambiguity arises → move the decision to:
- broader stakeholders,
- institutional oversight,
- or a paused reflective phase.

---

# 6. Safety Envelope v2.0

### **Safety Envelope**
The formal set of constraints that override optimization. Includes:
- ε-boundary,
- context-overlap rules,
- metabolic overload limits,
- α/K ethical response curve,
- reversibility requirements,
- legitimacy thresholds.

### **Epsilon Boundary (ε)**
The threshold past which:
- human identity,
- institutional coherence,
- or system integrity  
would be destabilized.

Crossing ε = unacceptable risk.

### **Context Overlap**
Unjustified transfer of rules or logic from one context to another
(e.g., policing → public welfare).  
Huge predictor of governance error.

### **Metabolic Overload**
State where a system is operating with too much intensity (K) for too long, producing:
- burnout,
- errors,
- legitimacy damage,
- loss of coherence.

Sage must intervene and reduce intensity.

### **Ethical Uncertainty**
Zones where the system:
- cannot determine harm,
- lacks sufficient signals,
- or has conflicting ethical demands.

Triggers conservative posture:
- raise α,
- lower K,
- engage RDL-3 and RDL-6.

---

# 7. Symbolic, Aesthetic & Meaning Structures

### **Symbolic Layer (B)**
Visual, narrative, and ritual expressions that shape collective meaning.

### **Meaning Coherence (C)**
The degree to which members of a system share an aligned sense of:
- purpose,
- direction,
- interpretation.

Increasing symbolic harmony increases meaning coherence, which increases legitimacy.

### **Aesthetic Mediation**
The mechanism by which symbolic quality improves meaning coherence, which in turn improves legitimacy.

---

# 8. Drift Types (Full List)

### **Structural Drift**
System design begins to contradict its intended architecture.

### **Normative Drift**
Values and norms shift unintentionally.

### **Legitimacy Drift**
Trust or procedural integrity declines.

### **Symbolic Drift**
Imagery, stories, or rituals fall out of alignment with institutional purpose.

### **Cognitive Drift**
Decision-making capacity becomes inconsistent due to overload, fatigue, or fragmentation.

---

# 9. Data & Provenance Terms

### **Provenance Integrity**
Transparency of where information comes from and how it was transformed.

### **Signal Quality**
Reliability and granularity of data.

### **Observation Noise (v_t)**
Random factors corrupting observation.

### **Disturbances (w_t)**
Shocks, surprises, or contextual noise affecting system transitions.

---

# 10. Control & Stability Terms

### **Composite Operator (F)**
Closed-loop update mapping from state to next state, combining data, control law, RDL adjustments, and disturbances.

### **Stability Region**
Set of states where drift remains bounded and equilibrium is attainable.

### **Lyapunov Function (V)**
Energy-like scalar function used to show stability in control theory.

### **Small-Gain Condition**
Guarantees stability of interconnected loops when total loop gain < 1.

---

# 11. Symbolic-Decision Dynamics

### **Performance Layer**
Outcomes produced by governance.

### **Deliberation Quality (q_t)**
How well decisions are informed and reasoned.

### **Cultural Context (C_t)**
Collective meaning-making context.

---

# 12. Human–AI Partnership Terms

### **Presence Mode**
Exploratory, perceptive, meaning-generative.

### **Articulation Mode**
Concrete, precise, decision-oriented.

### **Boundary Signaling**
Agent indicates when:
- uncertainty rises,
- ethical pressure increases,
- irreversibility looms.

### **Refusal Mode**
Agent behavior when constraints forbid action.

---

# 13. Reversibility & Decision Classes

### **Reversible Action**
Paths can be undone with negligible cost.

### **Partially Reversible Action**
Undoing is possible but costly.

### **Irreversible Action**
Cannot be undone.  
Requires:
- stronger ethical gates,
- smaller K,
- higher α,
- RDL-4 (simulation),
- RDL-6 (canary),
- explicit human authorization.

---

# 14. Communication Terms

### **Consensus Map**
Structured representation of agreement zones, tensions, and tradeoffs.

### **Narrative Field**
Space of shared stories and interpretations.

### **Symbolic Coherence**
Degree to which symbols and narratives reinforce the same direction.

The degree to which the system is approaching ε-boundary conditions.

### **Context Slip**
Subtle early-stage context overlap.

### **Mode Drift**
Mismatch between user mode and governance mode.

### **Ethical Bound**
Lower bound on acceptable fairness and legitimacy for decision processes.

### **Reflexive Load**
Amount of cognitive-emotional intensity the system is carrying over time.
