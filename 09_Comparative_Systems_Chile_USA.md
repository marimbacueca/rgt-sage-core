# Comparative Systems — Chile & USA (v3.6.1)

**Chile.** Legitimacy repair focus; heavier fairness weight; q* ~0.55–0.65.  
**USA.** Cadence control focus; r/κ and misinformation cycles.

**Shared invariants.** R*, Λ<1, audit contraction, C-gate, DU standard, AM2+ visuals.

**Pilots (90 days, external).**
- US municipal backlog policy.
- Chile community participation ordinance.

**Metrics.** ΔL, q uplift, audit SLA, parity.

> *RGT does not command; it listens in rhythm.  
> Every audit is a breath, every correction a pulse.  
> A system lives when its motion teaches it how to move.*
